            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOURS PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Siege of <hi>Rochel</hi> had its firſt beginning, I was but in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of my Age, and having been bred to commerce, wanted the advantage and ornament of Scholarſhip; yet nevertheleſs my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity prompting me, I made it my buſineſs to take notice of what then paſſed, and my Father being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Common Council, and as Maſter of the Artillery exerciſed the ſecond Charge or Office in the City, I learned from him divers Particulars, which I carefully committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: And though I had at that time
<pb facs="tcp:102984:3"/>nothing leſs in my thoughts than to compoſe a Narrative for the Publick, yet being cloiſtred up until the Rendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the City, I find this Journal compleat, even until the end of the Siege, which I kept only for my own particular uſe, in caſe the Lord in his mercy ſhould ſuffer me to ſurvive; from whence it is that this Collection hath ever ſince lain dormant in my Cabinet, and nothing but the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of friends could have carried me beyond my own reſolution in expoſing it to publick view. Neither my Age, my Profeſſion, nor yet the little care I then took in digeſting of things (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them only for my ſelf) can beget in any an expectation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in Form or Style worthy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal, having nothing more to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it than integrity as to matter of Fact, of which thoſe at a diſtance, as well as thoſe at home, muſt bear
<pb facs="tcp:102984:3"/>witneſs, it being a plain Narrative of Counſels and Tranſactions during the Siege, without any Inferences of my own: In the collecting of which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intereſt, Affection, or Hatred had any influence upon me.</p>
            <p>As this Age is fruitful in great Wits, ſo theſe Memoirs may be uſeful to the Writers of the Hiſtorie of our Times: However, ſome may haply be glad to underſtand the Particulars which I have here given an Account of.</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now fifty one years ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion and Liberty received its great wound in the loſs of <hi>Rochel,</hi> a City in <hi>France,</hi> once famous for its conſtant oppoſition of <hi>Rome,</hi> and being a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the Proteſtants of that Kingdom, in the frequent Maſſacres practiſed by the (more than cruel and bruitiſh) Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Whoever ſhall read <hi>D' Aubignie's</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (not <hi>D' Avila's,</hi> againſt which the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med excepts as partial) of the Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> writ in or near the time of King
<pb facs="tcp:102984:4"/>
               <hi>Henry IV.</hi> Grandfather to the preſent King of <hi>England,</hi> will find that this City was of great ſervice to that King in all his troubles, as being a Sanctuary to him upon ſeveral occaſions, conſtantly taking his part againſt his Enemies, the Popiſh and Spaniſh League and Faction.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Henry IV.</hi> (like a magnanimous and generous Soul) excelling in gratitude and good Nature (tyranny and oppreſſion being the Badges and effects of diſſoluteneſs and cowardiſe) when by the aſſiſtance of the Reformed he was reſtored to the Crown and Dignity of <hi>France,</hi> did not unthankfully forget his friends, and perſecute them, but as a heroick Prince made them participate of the mercies of God towards him, by giving them (as their <hi>Magna Charta</hi>) the Edict or Law, Called that of <hi>Nantes,</hi> with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementary Articles, by which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in all caſes to equal Priviledges with the Romaniſts; for though to do the like by Papiſts in a Proteſtant Country would be the
<pb facs="tcp:102984:5"/>certain ruine of that Nation (their faithleſs bloody Principles, and owning of a Foreign Head being inconſiſtent with ſuch liberty) yet he knew that nothing could be of more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to his Crown than to cheriſh thoſe that owned no other Sovereign than their Native Prince, and could have no other Intereſt than his, as his Succeſſors have ſince experienced, both of them being indebted to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for keeping their Crowns upon their heads.</p>
            <p>After ſeveral former Edicts or Laws had been no ſooner made for the ſecurity of the Religion than broke, the reformed Party (who had for their Heads the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Condée,</hi> beſides a multitude of other Grandees) refuſing to rely any longer upon Paper Edicts and the word of a King, demanded Cautionary Towns, and had amongst others the City of <hi>Rochel</hi> given them for one.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this excellent Prince, <hi>Henry IV.</hi> lived, his Edict and ſupplementary Articles hereunto annexed (declarative of many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:102984:5"/>Edicts) were faithfully obſerved; but he was no ſooner gone than his Succeſſours, loſing all gratitude, choſe rather to follow the vicious examples of his Predeceſſors than the vertuous Precedent that he left them, of being true and faithful to Laws and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for at the importunity of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (enemies to true piety) ſetting aſide all faith and reverence due to Laws, made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and irrevocable, they took up a ſevere perſecution of the Reformed; from whence aroſe ſeveral Wars, and as many reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for the innocent Proteſtants, thirſting after nothing but Peace in the enjoyment of their Laws, were always deluded out of their advantages to rely upon fair promiſes, and the inſignificant word of their King: Until <hi>Lewis XIII.</hi> having firſt prepared all Matters, took his opportunity to fall upon this City, the chief Bulwark of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which reſisted upon the account of their Priviledges, as a Cautionary Town, thinking it as lawful to defend their Rights, as for
<pb facs="tcp:102984:6"/>the King to invade them; and how the place was loſt appears by the enſuing Journal or History; which ſhews,</p>
            <p>I. A Miracle (and perhaps beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) of Unity, Courage, Conſtancy, and Reſolution, to die rather than outlive their Liberty.</p>
            <p>II. In all the Managers of their defence (as well at home as abroad during the Siege) more of faithfulneſs, diligence, prudence, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of Wit and Parts than peradventure will be found in any Hiſtory, eſpecially of its bigneſs.</p>
            <p>The loſs of this City was the firſt decay of the Proteſtant Cauſe and Intereſt in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Original Riſe and Foundation of that Greatneſs in the French Monarchy, which threatens at this day the Liberty of <hi>Europe;</hi> for ſo long as <hi>Rochel</hi> remained in freedom under a Maior, his Council, and the Common Council of forty eight, annually choſen by themſelves, they were ſo formidable under that Government, that the French
<pb facs="tcp:102984:6"/>could never get forward in ſuppreſſing thoſe of the Religion, nor oppreſſing of their Neighbours, which renders the Spaniard guilty of a great Soleciſm in Politicks, in being aſſistant in the reducing of this City, as well as <hi>Spinola,</hi> the Great Spaniſh Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (but a Native of <hi>Genoua</hi>) was in contriving the <hi>Digue</hi> (a Bank which block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Paſſage by Sea into <hi>Rochel</hi>) the means of taking it, which he did at his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the French King a Viſit in his paſſage to <hi>Spain;</hi> for though the Author of this Hiſtory will not take from his own Country the credit of the Invention, the honour of it doth traly belong to <hi>Spinola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that you may the better understand how the Reformed in <hi>France</hi> have been, and ſtill are, dealt with contrary to Law, I have hereunto annexed the ſeveral Declarations of <hi>Henry IV.</hi> eſtabliſhing thereby his Edict and ſupplementary Articles for their Liberty, making them perpetual and irrevocable, as alſo the ſeveral Declarations of this preſent
<pb facs="tcp:102984:7"/>French King <hi>Louis XIV.</hi> reciting the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Declarations of his Father <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is XIII.</hi> with ſeveral Decrees of Council, owning the perpetuity of the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and confirming them all with this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, That he remained fully ſatisfied with his Subjects of the Reformed Religion, as having given him certain proofs of their affection and fidelity, eſpecially in 1652. the year of his Declaration, when they drew the hatred of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon them for their Loyalty, in adhering to the King, and oppoſing of the Prince in his then Rebellion. But the King by their help had not long got the Aſcendant of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, before holding the Reformed unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to ſatisfie the inſatiable malice of the Biſhops (as appears by their actings, which will in due time be publiſhed) he left them to the mercy of the Church, whoſe mercies are cruelties, and even ſuffered the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to revenge himſelf upon them, who, the firſt year he was reſtored into favour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed
<pb facs="tcp:102984:7"/>all their Churches in the <hi>Pais de Gex,</hi> near <hi>Geneve,</hi> and under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which County wanted then little of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intirely of the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>Yet, that I may do the former times right, I cannot but obſerve the Candor and Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (acknowledged in this Hiſtory) of the French Miniſters of State at the taking of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who, when ſome malicious enough (and moſt likely the Biſhop of <hi>Mande,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Siege, and others of his Order in <hi>France,</hi> who never conſult truth, but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantage) would have had it aſſigned in the Kings Declaration as a reaſon of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Armes, that the Rochellers did not only call in the Engliſh, but alſo gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to them; the then Chancellour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Regiſters of the Maior and Council of <hi>Rochel,</hi> the Memorials and Inſtructions given by them to their Deputies ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and the Treaties made by them with that King, to be all exactly peruſed and examined, and finding that the ſaid Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb facs="tcp:102984:8"/>and Treaties had been always made with a reſerve of the fidelity due to the Crown, he would not ſuffer anything of that nature to be inſerted in the Kings Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it did not appear to be true; a piece of honeſt Morality little practiſed in theſe days in <hi>France,</hi> ſome Men there having now no other Politicks than little tricks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides lying and diſſembling (all eaſily ſeen tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) for which they would be thought great Statiſts; but Honeſty, as King <hi>James</hi> (who knew enough) uſed to ſay, is the beſt Policy. And to give <hi>Richelieu</hi> (a Perſon of vaſt abilities and clear Parts) his due; His treating with the Rochellers in their greateſt diſtreſs, ſeems to have been with more moderation, ſincerity, and plainneſs than is in this Age common or uſual among them.</p>
            <p>And now by comparing the preſent French Kings Perſecution of his Reformed Subjects, with his former Declarations, confirming and making perpetual and irrrevocable all
<pb facs="tcp:102984:8"/>Edicts and Lawsmade for their Liberty and Security in the exerciſe of their Religion, as a reward for their acknowledged fidelity and good ſervice, may and ought to be obſerved by Proteſtants how little the Faith and Laws of Popiſh Princes are to be relied upon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in matters of Religion.</p>

Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, when this Faction perceived that all was to no purpoſe, without prohibiting this City all Trade to Sea, under pretext of an Imaginary Society of Commerce, they have built a number of Ships of War; but doubting that it would be ſufficient to their deſign to fortifie themſelves at Sea, without at the ſame time weakning there the King our Maſter, by an unexampled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Injuſtice, in the midſt of a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace, and at a time when the King our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was deeply ingaged in War, by whch the Aſſurance and Riches of <hi>France</hi> increaſed, they

                              <p>For theſe Reaſons alledged, and many other of the ſame nature, the King our Maſter, the moſt Religious and Pious Prince in the World, ſetting aſide all other Reſpects than that of his Conſcience, hath a Sympathy of your Sufferings, and his own Honour; and finding himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Promiſe to procure the accompliſhment of the Articles agreed upon, eſpecially being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thereunto by my Lords, the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> in the Name of the whole Body of the Reformed Religion, he hath therefore ſent hither my Lord, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me in Charge, to make you an Offer in his Name, of a powerful aſſiſtance, as well by Land as Sea (in caſe you reſolve to accept of it) for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming your Liberty, by joyning with you in an actual War, which he will do upon ſuch Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as you your ſelves, Gentlemen, and all the World ſhall acknowledge, that the King our Maſter hath no Eye to his own advantage, but vour good, the vindication of his Honour, and diſcharge of his Conſcience: for his Majeſty is far from purſuing any Demands or Pretenſions of his own, or to invade the Territories of the <hi>French</hi> King, his Brother, with whom he deſires to come to a perfect Union, ſo it may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the aſſurance of thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> who make Profeſſion of the ſame Religion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                              <p>But at preſent the proceedings of this Eſtate hath put his Majeſty out of doubt, as to their deſigns, and left him at liberty, by having trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under feet the Reverence due to Publick Treaties; and therefore, if you refuſe this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, you will hereafter ſeek it in vain; and in ſuch caſe, my Lord the Duke of <hi>Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham</hi> hath commanded me to make a Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, before God and Man, that he holds the King his Maſter in Honour and Conſcience fully acquitted from all Engagements, and his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency will diſpoſe himſelf to execute the other Commands which he hath in Charge.

Monſieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> who expected him there with 200 Horſe, and 8 or 900 Foot, uſed all his endeavours to hinder his deſcent, and put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into ſuch confuſion, that a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were drowned: Nevertheleſs the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his deſcent in ſuch ſort, that he landed near 3000 men; Monſieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> was forced to retreat, and the rather becauſe the ſhips ſhot upon him with advantage, which obliged him to retire to the next Town called <hi>Lafflot,</hi> and from thence to the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> leaving upon the place about 300 foot, and of the horſe about 80 among which was found; his Brother Monſieur <hi>Reſtingliers</hi> the Baron <hi>Navails, Chantail,</hi> and <hi>Tablier;</hi> for which, as alſo, for the Officers of the Infantrie, he ſent the next morning by a Trumpiter, deſiring them of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who granted his requeſt: And as to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> this action coſt them near 500 men; but above all Monſieur <hi>Blancard,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of rare merit, who had negotiated all this affair, and was as the ſoul that moves all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, inſomuch that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſing him, they found themſelves Stripped of their Principal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor.</p>
                  <p>The 23d the Council aſſembled in the City-Hall to hear the report of their Commiſſioners; It being ordered formerly, that nothing of importance ſhould be reſolved upon, which concerned the Church in general, without taking time for knowing their Advice: For acquainting the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>At this ſame time it was propoſed in Council by ſome of <hi>Rochel,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Maran,</hi> to bring upon their own adventure, a great quantity of Corn and Wine into <hi>Rochel</hi> conditionally, that in caſe the City had not need thereof for the Publick, it ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to ſell at reaſonable rates to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, and in caſe it ſhould happen that neither the one nor the other, had by reaſon of a Peace any need, they ſhould tranſport them whither they ſhould think fit. This propoſition was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the greateſt part of the Council, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt profitable for the publick good of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſome of the principal, who were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in their particular Intereſt, than was the generality of the people; becauſe they had ſome Wine to ſell, and hoped for a good Vintage, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the propoſition as to Wines very ſtrongly, alledging that it would be the breach of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which their Anceſtors had religiouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from Father to Son, and by this means ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vines of the Government unprofitable, and ſo concluded that they ſhould not admit their offer ſave only as to Corn; The Merchants propoſing, Remonſtrated hereupon that for two reaſons they could not make this contract for Corn alone. The one that they ſhould loſe by it without hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing their loſs, otherwiſe than by Wine. Secondly, That if they ſhould carry away their

                     <fw>1627.

In concluſion to ingage the City they offered to pay a Crown Cuſtom for every Tun, but notwithſtanding all that they could ſay, the intereſted prevailed, alledging that the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powerful at Sea, and near to them, could eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour ſend them Corn, Wine, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Commodities, more then they wanted, but this obſtinate Counſel coſt them dear in the end.</p>
                  <p>After the deſcent and Fight made by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ree,</hi> three days paſſed without any attempt made by either party one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other, only Monſieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> by little Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes kept his enemies in breath, but expecting another Fight, retired to the Burrough of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> and from thence into the Citadel with all that he was able to bring thither. The Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> fortified and intrenched himſelf in the place where he made his deſcent, as well becauſe he had not the knowledg of the Country, as that he dreaded the Forces of the Iſle, which he feared were great, and gathering together to fall upon his people, who had not well recovered their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at Sea, and misfortunes at Land: Nevertheleſs in common opinion, if he had briskly followed Monſieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> he had carried the Citadel at one of the Gates, which was not finiſhed, where ten or twelve men on breſt might have entered, beſides that it was ill provided with Victuals and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, which during this delay they carried day and night thither: and alſo induſtriouſly repaired the weakeſt parts of the Fortifications.</p>

                     <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 7th of <hi>September,</hi> twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pinnaces, laden with all ſort of Proviſions, entred the Citadel, having paſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Pinnaces, Shalloops, and Pallaſades, which by Storms the night before had been half broken and bruiſed; which continuing, obliged thoſe in the Ships of the Pallaſade to cut their Cables which tyed them together, which happened well to thoſe in the Citadel, who were not able to do any more, and who were ſo preſſed, that had this Succour ſtaid three days longer, the Sieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> muſt have been forced to have delivered the place: but as this was matter of great joy to them, ſo it was of grief and ſorrow to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who by break of day diſcharged his Choler by the Mouth of his Cannon upon the Citadel and Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday</hi> the 10th, about four or five in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> obſerving the working at a place over againſt the two Mills, fired their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non upon them, the Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> anſwering them in the ſame kind, which croſſed the City, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any harm; ſo that by this mutual thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, they declared War one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, about eight in the Evening, the Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> fired three Cannon-ſhot with Fire-Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, one of which fell in a Houſe full of Hay and

                     <fw>1627. Septemb.</fw> Straw, near a Stack of green Wood, which was entirely burnt: At firſt this new Invention aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them much, and obliged them to ſeek reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the like.</p>
                  <p>The 11th, the Council ſitting in the Town-Hall, and the whole Body aſſembled, Commiſſioners were ordered to conſider upon conditions for the Minting of Money; as alſo the Mayor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were deſired to publiſh a Manifeſt, and to ſee to the Articles of Conjunction with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 12th, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> received a Recruit of 2500, by ſeven Ships and four Flutes. The ſame day the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took two Barks laden with Proviſions and Munition of War for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, and gave Chaſe to a Ship which followed the Bark, and purſued her unto the Stuckets or Pallaſades.</p>
                  <p>The 13th, in the Evening, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome at work near the Houſe of <hi>Coureille,</hi> for the raiſing of a Fort, they played their Cannon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The ſame day, in the Evening, came from the Iſle of <hi>Re</hi> to <hi>Rochel</hi> the Sieurs <hi>Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and St. <hi>Surin</hi> for the Sieur <hi>Thoiras,</hi> in their way to the King at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> from whence <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> (after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with his Majeſty) was to go to <hi>England,</hi> and began their journey the next day: And this was the effect of the Communications before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, when all believed, the Duke being cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Surin,</hi> he would find this Voyage to no purpoſe, as it proved.</p>
                  <p>The 15th, <hi>Monſieur</hi> the King's only Brother ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Eſtre,</hi> and skirmiſhed his Cavalry with thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who after ſome ſmall loſs gave

The ſame day, about eight in the Evening, they from the Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> made five ſhot with Fire-Bullets upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Fire took effect in a Houſe near the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where there were Fagots, and the cuttings of Vines, but it was extinguiſhed without burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than the Roof, and part of the Wood.</p>
                  <p>The 16th, the Mayor made Proclamation tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all the Quarters of the City, commanding every one to remove out of their high Chambers, and Garrets, Wood, Hay, Straw, and whatever was ſubject to fire, and to keep there Oxe-hides, Pales and Tubs of Water, as well to quench the Fire, as to throw upon the Bullets.</p>
                  <p>The 17th, a Party of Cavalry ſallying out of <hi>Rochel</hi> ſome days before upon Adventure, brought into the City a Courrier which the King had ſent with a Packet to the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters for particular Perſons in the Army, by which was diſcovered the King's deſign of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the <hi>Rochellers</hi> by Sea with a Bank, and a Naval Army, and incloſing them on the Land-ſide with a ſtrong Line of Communication; and ſo to gain them by hunger, rather than force, according to the Tenure of that to the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> which is as followeth.</p>

                        <p>I approve alſo of the Forts and Retrenchments that you are upon at <hi>Bongrenne</hi> and <hi>Moulinette.</hi> I will believe that they are near (if not before this done to your hands) in defence; it behoves us to preſerve theſe two Poſtes, ſince they are judged neceſſary: but except you determine making at preſent the Fort that you have propoſed betwixt the Port <hi>de Coinge</hi> and <hi>la Fons,</hi> for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>I know, That for the accompliſhing theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, for conſerving your Poſts, for hindering on the Land-ſide the going in and out of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and provide againſt diverſions, it is neceſſary to maintain a good Army, well paid: That which you propoſe to me to have about <hi>Rochel</hi> ought to be 10000 Foot, and 1000 Horſe effective, which will be done when the Orders that I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given for the marching and levying of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have been executed; as you may ſee by the numbers of the Regiments of Foot that I have ſent you.</p>

Conſidering that ſo long as the Citadel of S. <hi>Martin</hi> can hold, there is no fear of the Fort of <hi>Pree;</hi> I ſee no neceſſity of ſending men thither, though there may be of Victuals and Munition, after that the Citadel ſhall be ſufficiently provided.</p>

                        <p>I have well conſidered the Retinue that you ſay the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> (upon the Declaration of War,) are reſolved to keep; and how you acknowledge it to proceed more from fear than love or reſpect; and that you will not ſpare to act effectually againſt them, as if they had already declared; all which I approve, ſince their actions and deportment do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhew their evil intentions, and therefore you may permit thoſe of the Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> to work upon their Fortifications, ſince you think fit to make ſome new ones.</p>
                        <p>I am pleaſed that you have ſent ſome Cavalry to my Brother the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and doubt whether he will be with the Army before this Anſwer; if he be, fail not to communicate this to him, to the end that he be informed of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The 26th. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> publiſhed their Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, by which they gave an Account of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Reaſons which moved them to joyn Arms with the King of <hi>Great-Brittain;</hi> and put at the foot of the ſame their Kings Letter to the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> as alſo the Oath of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh made to <hi>Robert Cadiot,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Rochel,</hi> 1472.</p>
                  <p>In this Manifeſt they ſay, That one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace in 1622, which is recited, was the demoliſhing of the Fort built near the City during the War, as alſo that accordingly the King had given Letters to their Deputies, Dated the 18th of <hi>December,</hi> directed to <hi>Sieur Arnoult,</hi> by which he enjoyns him not to delay doing it, but that under divers pretexts he did not only elude the obeying him therein, but on the contrary continued to fortifie it; and after his death the <hi>Sieur Thoiras</hi> did the ſame more diligently;

                     <fw>1627. Octob.</fw> ſo that neither their Complaints, nor the reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Complaints of their Deputies to his Majeſty of the breach of Agreements, could produce any effect. That their deſign in preſerving this Fort, and furniſhing it ſo much, appeared ſufficiently by the ſeveral Enterpriſes that had been made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the City. This was the occaſion which moved the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with whom the Peace of 1622 had been Treated, to take Arms, and give cauſe to the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> to make an Enterprize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Blavet,</hi> and to aſſure himſelf of the Iſle of <hi>Re</hi> and the City, and to joyn with them; becauſe that though they had not declar'd, but ſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the King to obtain the juſtice of having this Fort demoliſhed, inſtead of the King's effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual agreeing thereunto, the Marſhal <hi>Praſlin</hi> was come againſt them in Arms, committing Acts of Hoſtility. That the following Peace, having been made by the Interceſſion of the Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> under divers Articles, and above all apon the word of a King, even given to the ſaid Ambaſſadours in writing, that within ſix Months the Fort ſhould be demoliſhed, yet nothing of it had been obſerved: That inſtead of ſuffering them to bring back their Goods, the <hi>Sieur Thoiras</hi> had ſeized them, and carryed away all their Salt, and built a Citadel in the Iſle of <hi>Re.</hi> That inſtead of reducing the Garriſons to the number agreed upon, they had been increaſed in ſuch ſort, that there was alwayes near eight or ten thouſand men round the City. That upon the paſſages to <hi>Maran,</hi> and other places, they had built new Forts, which blocked the City, and hindred the bringing in of Corn and Proviſions. That the <hi>Sieur Thoiras</hi> did

                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Sieur Briel,</hi> ſent as Intendant of the Court of Juſtice, had committed unheard of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; as the putting a Souldier to death upon ſuſpicion of having broken a Crucifix in time of War, which afterwards was proved falſe, the Crucifix being found. That contrary to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges agreed to with the City by the King, which was not of Grace, but under Covenant given to <hi>France;</hi> That they charged the City as belonging to the <hi>Domane,</hi> eſtabliſhing Offices for taxing the Corn and Wine of the Government, ſent Commands to <hi>Sieur Thoiras,</hi> Governour of the City, to build the ſaid Fort and Citadel. That beſides theſe Injuries done them in particular, thoſe of the Religion, in general, were ill uſed thorough the whole Kingdom, and their Edicts violated in all the heads. That hereupon the King of <hi>England,</hi> who on behalf of the King, was to them <hi>Garrantee</hi> of the Peace, (which was ſo little obſerved) having ineffectually imployed his Interceſſion, reſolved upon taking Arms; and having ſent his Army into theſe Quarters, they ſent Deputies to the Duke of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> who was in Arms ſo near to them as <hi>Maran,</hi> to ſatisfie him by proteſtation, That they deſired to remain invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in their Fidelity and Obedience to the King, and to beſeech him to intercede with the King for their enjoyment of the laſt Treaty of Peace. That inſtead of hearkening thereunto, he declar'd War againſt them, plundering their Houſes, building of Forts too near to them, and committing open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all acts of Hoſtlity, whilſt they yet held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

In the end there fell into their hands the Kings Letters to the ſaid Duke, of the 13th of <hi>September,</hi> where they found the Map of their ruine, and the Order for beſieging them both by Sea and Land: That being reduced to this point, they ſaw themſelves forced to take Arms, and to joyn with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> praying all their good Country-men, and all good Kings and Princes to approve of their Deſign, and to aſſiſt them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, under proteſtation nevertheleſs to remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the duty of Subjection and Fidelity due to the King; and that they ſhould be ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to him, when it ſhould pleaſe him to receive them into his favour, and cauſe the breach which had been made upon the Edicts to be repaired, and to eſtabliſh them in their ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Priviledges.</p>

                  <p>As to the Treaty of Peace which followed, it was falſe that Strangers had acted therein as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, that the King had given his word to them, or conſented to that Injury of their Maſter's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garrantees to his Subjects, as the Ambaſſadors of <hi>England</hi> have ſince told him. That if after this Treaty the King thought good to build a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel in the Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> and Forts in the Paſſages from the Iſle of <hi>Maran,</hi> it was no more than what was too apparently neceſſary for bridling a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious City, who then tampered with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and further, that it was contrary to truth, that on that ſide they had committed any act of Hoſtility, as all <hi>France</hi> knows, but that the Paſſages for going, and coming, and bringing all ſorts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, was free to all. As to the Offices eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed contrary to their pretended Priviledges, and the Commands of the Governour, given to the <hi>Sieur Thoiras,</hi> that as theſe Priviledges were from the King's Grace, and not as they ſay, by Covenant, ſo when they were fallen from their Duty it was moſt juſt to revoke them; as in the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, who diſſolv'd their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall, and gave them a Governour, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received them to Mercy, until upon their Knees, and with Tears, they all made ſupplication for Mercy. That the Judgment given againſt him who broke a Crucifix was judiciouſly done, upon ſufficient Informations. That the Complaints of

                     <fw>1627. Octob.</fw> the generality of their Religion, in the reſt of the Kingdom, was without Vouchers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the free and entire Exerciſe the King granted them, and his protection under which they lived peaceably. That the Invaſions of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and their deſcent in Arms in the Iſle of <hi>Re</hi> made in full Peace, and without any precedent Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War, was contrary to Juſtice, and the Law of Nations, which the King will make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the end. That if the <hi>Rochellers</hi> at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, declaring for them, and ſent Deputies to the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> it was in deſign to gain time, and during that delay to make their Harveſt, for the King was moſt certainly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd that the coming of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was agreed upon with them; and though they had not yet in words declar'd for them, it was done in effect, in receiving Deputies from the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and ſending theirs to him, and aiding him every day with Proviſions; that ſo the King had juſt cauſe to declare them Guilty of High-Treaſon, and make them ſuffer for their Rebellion, and he hopes in the end to make them Examples for it.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid day, with the Morning-tide, the <hi>Sieurs David</hi> and <hi>Dehinſſe</hi> went to the Iſle of <hi>Re</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Sieur Salbret,</hi> who was with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and from thence to go into <hi>England,</hi> to return that Prince thanks for his Aſſiſtance, and to beg the continuance of it, repreſenting to him their State and Condition; with them went to the ſaid Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> to reſide near the perſon of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs Deſherbiers,</hi> and <hi>Bragneau,</hi> for the City-Hall; and <hi>Goyer Junier,</hi> (a good man and experienced Sea-Captain) for the

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſchant,</hi> and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening we reached the Reer-guard; and ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, that we re-encountred the Dukes Ship; and ſo ſoon as he heard that we were there, appeared upon the Hatches to bid us welcom, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs obliging us to come aboard. The next day about Noon, when we were near en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the Narrow Seas, he cauſed himſelf to be ſet aboard our Pinnace, and drawing us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, told us, that the Wind being come good, his Captains would not loſe the opportunity of it; that in the mean time he had given order, that the Corn, Hay, and the other ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſhould go to you, but he underſtood that they had followed the Army, for which at their arrival they ſhould render him an account. And further, that he was come into our Ship, having given order to all the reſt of the Fleet to go to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> whilſt he would go with us to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where he hoped to find the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the ſuccours deſigned us, and give ſuch Orders in our affairs, as we ſhould be well content with. Accordingly, on <hi>Monday</hi> the 22th, we landed at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where we met a part of the Fleet, and particularly our <hi>French,</hi> which were in a moſt pitiful condition; and the Duke, according to his hopes, met there alſo the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> with whom having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and read ſome Letters his Majeſty writ to him: He immediately ſent for us, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſaid Earl declared, that the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King his Maſter was to aſſiſt us with lla his Might: that if the ſuccours were not arrived

March.</fw> in time, the blame ought not to be imputed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than to the Winds which had failed them three times, (and that the third time was the ſame day we arrived, but believed that ſome Veſſels would gain your Port) that for the time to come, we ſhould reſent the effects of his good will; and for the preſent, wiſhed us to adviſe among our ſelves of the moſt preſſing neceſſities: Upon which offer, returning him thanks, we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Hunger as our moſt dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at preſent; and therefore ſupplicated the Duke to remember the promiſe that he had made us for Corn, to give order for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>French,</hi> and to add to them two or three hundred <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſuffereth in the preſent neceſſity. Upon this we left him, and the ſame day were viſited by Monſieur <hi>Dolbier,</hi> who entertained us upon the two Heads of our Demand, and upon the laſt (to wit) the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, asked if we underſtood that they ſhould be armed: To which we anſwered, that nothing was more neceſſary, the City being very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of Arms, having loſt a great number in their late Rencounters. Upon the other Head, to wit, of Corn, we found our ſelves as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants upon Thorns, he repreſenting to us ſome Emence expences that the King had been at in this Affair, and that he muſt maintain it in the future: Beſide that, he told us, that the Duke had ſpent more than one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> of his own Eſtate. In brief, to bring it to a Head, he deſired to know of us, if we could aſſure the payment of it. Now though we deſired to procure this Eaſement, and make as if it was ſent you freely, nevertheleſs,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102984:42"/>
                           <fw>1628. March.</fw> fearing that by being obſtinate in it, we ſhould loſe all; or at leaſt, that things would be ſo delayed, that it would be very prejudicial to you, we ingaged that you ſhould receive, with great Reſentment of Obligation, if it would pleaſe the Duke to make only the advance, and render it to you at the Head of the Bay, whither you would ſend to meet it, and give order for payment. We know very well, that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was a trouble to him; yet the next morning he came to our Lodgings, and told us, that as to the Souldiers, the thing was agreed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our deſire; and for the Corn, the Duke had reckoned upon five and twenty thouſand pounds, and had eſtabliſhed a certain <hi>Fond</hi> for other 25000 <hi>l.</hi> to the end to buy Proviſions for us, and that we ſhould underſtand it from his own mouth: And indeed, going after Dinner to try the iſſue, he confirmed to us the one, and the other; and told us, he would leave the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all to his Vice-Admiral, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and who is his Creature, and one of his Domeſticks, who he made expreſly to remain there to that end, demanding further of us, whether we would have the Ships ſent away one after another, as they ſhould be laden, or ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what they could at preſent, which would come to ten thouſand <hi>Francks,</hi> and ſend the reſt altogether with a Powerful Convoy. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving referred this to his Prudence, the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> who was there, concluded, that the laſt advice was to be followed: And ſo it was agreed, that one Ship of two hundred Tun ſhould be at preſent ſent away with ſo much Corn, and in the ſame all our <hi>French,</hi> order being given for the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102984:43"/>
                           <fw>1628. March.</fw> nouriſhment of them, whilſt they waited for a Wind. After this, the Duke told us, he would take Poſt for <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> to give Orders about the Army, and cauſe the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as we deſired, to be diſpatched with the firſt: and in the mean time, that we ſhould go ſtreight to <hi>London,</hi> where he ſhould not be wanting in all good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces poſſible: Upon which the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word, repreſented with great vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy how much his Majeſties intentions are for our good, and that we ought not to have any fear of ever being abandoned, and that this was but a beginning of what ſhould be well proſecuted; and that beſides the Fleet which he now ſends us, he would prepare another, and that we ſhould ſee the ſame, if they had any Ships. All was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with our returning thanks, and the Duke taking Poſt as he had ſaid, adviſed us to remain here a little, to ſee what diligence would be in performing what they promiſed us. Yeſterday we ſaw not here any other advancement, than that they provided for the nouriſhment of our poor <hi>French</hi> in the abſence of the Vice-Admiral; and having this day met with him, we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for our ſaid Countrymen 6 <hi>d. Sterl. per</hi> day, which is the moſt the King allows in this place, and which is an honeſt allowance, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them to live on, we having put them under the Conduct of Monſieur <hi>Savignac</hi> Enſign, and Monſieur <hi>de la Lande,</hi> that they together may have an eye upon the Money which ſhall be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Souldiers, and ſee it faithfully done. We cannot conceal from you, that this Enſign hath attacqued us with inſolent and injurious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the preſence of the Duke: As for

                           <fw>1628. March.</fw> Corn, we underſtand, that all poſſible diligence is uſed for the lading of it; ſo that our ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here being no longer requiſite, we do intend, God willing, to depart to morrow for <hi>London,</hi> but by different ways; (<hi>viz.</hi>) two of us by <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> where the Ship is, which from the beginning was deſigned us by the Duke, in which are our Men, Goods and Papers; and the third, which will be Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> by the way of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> not to be far from the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and to diſcourſe the Duke of <hi>Soubize.</hi> In brief, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, have, if you pleaſe, this conſidence in us, that we ſhall not ſpare either pains or care for the diſcharging our ſelves, the beſt we can, of the buſineſs you have been pleaſed to truſt us with, and commit unto us, and ſhall advertiſe you as oft as we can of whatſoever ſhall paſs. We ought not to omit, that beſides the Army im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked with the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> which were three thouſand Souldiers, there are ſix thouſand more, which the King hath in pay about this place, not reckoning the <hi>Scots,</hi> which are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly ready, and yet are levying other Troops; ſo that from all ſort of appearance we are made believe, that they do intend to ſuccour us in good earneſt, and we hope, that in the mean time, God will fortifie you: Some of thoſe who inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt themſelves in your Affairs, ſeem to be of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that you will be abandoned, but we hope you will provide Antidotes againſt ſuch evil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, for we are confident, that their fears are vain, and that things are in ſuch a condition, as give us cauſe of hoping well; and therefore retreat not to the hearkening to a Peace, which will be ruinous, as without doubt it will be ſuch,

We beg it of you again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to Sieur <hi>Faux,</hi> the Bearer hereof, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to you what we may have omitted: We will not add more at preſent, than to addreſs our prayers to him who hath been hitherto your Keeper, that he will ſtill incompaſs you with his Protection.</p>

                        <p>THis is our third ſince our arrival in this Iſle. We writ from <hi>Plymouth</hi> the 24th paſt, and from <hi>Briſtol</hi> eight or ten days after, without troubling you with the repetition of what we have deſired for you: We ſhall now give you an account of what we have ſince done here, where we arrived the ſixth Current; we addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our ſelves to the Duke, who received us with demonſtration of moſt particular good-will and kindneſs, and the ſame hour he was the means of our Audience by his Majeſty, to whom having had the Honour to pay our Reſpects, Monſieur <hi>David</hi> returned him moſt humble thanks for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf upon the account of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, repreſenting to him how much it was aggravated ſince he had ſhewed his kindneſs to us, adding then a moſt earneſt Supplication for a ready and powerful aſſiſtance of you: We read in the Countenance of his Majeſty the gracious Anſwer which he made us, amounting in ſum to aſſure us, that though the ſucceſs had not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his good Intentions, he would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs continue to aſſiſt us to the making our Cauſe his own; adding, that he ſhould make the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours committed in what had been done, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements to him for the time to come: The Duke being preſent, and hearing what the King

                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>oduced us, ſo in like manner he brought us back. Some days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſpent in waiting upon the Privy Council, amongſt whom there were ſome that received us with great humanity, and aſſured us, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his Majeſty were ſo carried out for us, that we needed no Interceſſors; and amongſt the reſt, one ſaid, that his Diſcourſes by day, and Dreams in the Night, were nothing but of our Affairs; and another Principal Perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he would rather loſe his Crown, than not to make good his word to us. Theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Viſits did not ſo take up our time, but we applied our ſelves to the moſt Eſſential of our Affairs, and judging that the ſending of Corn was moſt to be preſſed, we addreſſed our ſelves for that to the Duke, eſpecially for that we underſtood that the Order given at <hi>Plymouth</hi> was to our great grief revoked; but thereunto he anſwered, that ſince his arrival in this place, they had found Corn much cheaper here, and in far greater quantity, than in other places, which had made him change his Order; ſaying further, that from that time they had with diligence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly applied themſelves to the buying of it; and by our continual ſolicitation ſince, it is in ſuch forwardneſs, that a great quantity of Corn is ready, wanting nothing but Veſſels, which we muſt hire, and agree for the Fraight, but we know not yet what Convoy they will give us; the Wind being contrary, hath kept ſome in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> which they did deſign to that purpoſe: Nevertheleſs, we are aſſured of ſome, and in all appearance will be ready in a few days to ſet ſail, if God give an opportunity: With the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102984:45"/>
                           <fw>1628. March.</fw> Corn you will receive, beſides <hi>French,</hi> four or five hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers which we have procured, with order for paying of them; as alſo of thoſe that you have already, both for the time paſſed, and to come. So ſoon as we are over this buſineſs, we ſhall preſs the other Heads, contained in the <hi>Memorials,</hi> which you gave us in Charge; but the importance of this would not ſuffer us to traverſe any other Propoſition. Moreover, it is the good pleaſure of his Majeſty, not to limit himſelf in his aſſiſtance with Proviſions, but gives us hope of a plentiful ſupply which is preparing, and for which the City of <hi>London</hi> hath lately fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with 12000 <hi>l.</hi> but we cannot think that they will be ready before the <hi>Spring.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who arrived here a day after us, improves all his power, being exceeding well received by his Majeſty, and in ſingular good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the Duke; ſo that he contributes not a little to our Affairs, in which we alſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him with us, as in a Cauſe which is common to us all: That which confirms us in the hopes that they will in good earneſt imbrace our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is the Anſwer that they have given lately to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Ambaſſador, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a Mediation for the Accommodation of the two Crowns, &amp; particularly deſires a more puiſſant aſſiſtance at Sea; but without in any kind touching this Propoſition, they gave him only for anſwer, that his Majeſty would continue to him, as he hath hitherto done, all the aſſiſtance promiſed; and when he hath need of Ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated therewith by the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and the States, who have their Commerce in the <hi>Baltick.</hi> You ſee, Sirs, the preſent condition of

We have received yours of the 24th paſſed, and do perceive what order you ſay you have given for payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with you, which we have made uſe of, according to what you have thereof writ us. The Proceedings of the Captains are very much diſliked, but yours ſuch, as give great ſatisfaction: The ſaid Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains will receive the Kings Commands when the Corn ſhall be diſpatched, which poſſibly will not be to the contentment of them all; in the mean time, it will not be diſpleaſing, that you oblige them to keep to their Duty.

Though each of us deſire to take this Voyage, we have agreed upon Monſieur <hi>Dehinſe,</hi> our Collegue, and yeſterday we went with him to take his leave of his Majeſty; he will tell you the good words that we then had, which were ſuch, as we think it our duty to give you in his own terms: (viz.) <hi>Receive not this as a Succour, but as a ſmall Refreſhment, to give Life and Courage to your City, until the ſeaſon of the year will permit a more powerful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to be ſent you: Aſſure your ſelves, that I will aſſiſt you in ſuch meaſure, as I will procure you a good Peace from the King of</hi> France, <hi>or oblige thoſe that incompaſs you to retire: Nay, aſſure your City, that I will never abandon you.</hi> Whereupon the Duke undertaking to ſpeak, told us, you ſee, <hi>Meſſieurs,</hi> you have the Word of a King for this; and all the reſt Sieur <hi>Dehinſe</hi> will illuſtrate to you more particularly, having with him the Requeſt we preſented to the Council the fourteenth preſent, as well as the Project betwixt his Majeſty and us, which hath been ſince agreed upon.

We went immediately to the Duke, and by his means preſented a new Requeſt to the Council, repreſenting your extremity; and that if you were not with all ſpeed relieved, you would be loſt without recovery. This gave a hot Allarm; and the Admiralty ſent us word, that aſſuredly they ſhould, within ſix Weeks, ſet out a Fleet puiſſant enough to ſhock thoſe that are in your Road; and in the mean time, ſince your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are ſo great, they were reſolved to lade with all diligence the Proviſions in ſmall Ships, for to ſend them you under the favour of a good Wind, that they may paſs by ſtealth. This is the advice that we ſent you by Land by two ſeveral Meſſengers, who went hence the fourth Current: Since this, all our imployment hath been to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit the ſpeedy diſpatching of the Proviſions, for which we have obtained a promiſe; and that the

Whilſt theſe things were in doing, Monſieur <hi>David</hi> delivered us yours of the 24th paſſed, and informed us of your Condition by word of mouth, having arrived here the ſeventh in the Evening. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we waited upon the Duke, and delivered him a Letter as from you, which was one of your ſigned Blanks, and after Dinner we were con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ducted by him, and the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> to his Majeſty, to whom we preſented yours, which we ſeconded with new and moſt inſtant ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in terms which ſhewed a vehement E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: His Anſwer was, that he had prevented our Demands, for that orders for all that we deſired was given. After which, he having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us the particular Eſtate of the City, and being anſwered by us according as you had particularly writ, touching the Propoſitions which had been made you, and your Anſwer, he ſaid, it was done like honeſt men; and he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for his part, he would never forſake you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Much contented with theſe good words we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away the day following, expecting ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and the next day we waited upon the Duke, begging of him, that the departure of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law might not be longer deferred; but the Dutcheſs, his Lady, being in Labour, we could not come to ſpeak with him: but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the Evening, that ſhe was happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a Son, we took occaſion, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to go and teſtifie the ſhare we took, and that which we knew you would take in his Joy; in which having evidenced a particular ſatisfaction,

Upon this, we again aſſured the ſame, and that Sieur <hi>Dehinſe</hi> ſhould to that end go to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and if need were, ſhould imbark himſelf with the Earl of <hi>Denby,</hi> to aſſiſt him with his advice, as there ſhould be occaſion, not judging that at preſent he would ſail directly to your City. This he ſeem'd to accept of, as very agreeable, and accordingly Sieur <hi>Dehinſe</hi> hath prepared to depart to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and will write you more particularly of the ſucceſs of the Voyage. In the mean time, we commit this to the care of Captain <hi>David,</hi> to the end, that if he come firſt to you, as he hopes by the aſſiſtance of God to do, you may be informed of the Progreſs we have been able to make hitherto; he will tell you by word of mouth the good words we have from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, having carried him with us when we went to deliver him yours; the thing we have only in doubt is, whether the Fleet can be ready in the time they put you in hopes of: But we aſſure our ſelves, that if you can be refreſhed with Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, you may well patient your ſelves ſome Weeks, in expectation from hence: However it is, it ſeems by all that we can ſee, that it is in good earneſt that they imbrace your Affairs; and

                                 <fw>1628 March</fw> The Gentleman that brought them (who is a witty man) negotiated with the Principal of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, for a Treaty of Accommodation, for which the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Denmark</hi> had formerly made ſome Overtures; we obſerved, that he gave them frequent Viſits, and that accordingly they took a ſudden reſolution to go to <hi>France,</hi> where we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered they had a deſign to purſue that Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                              <p>Upon this we had our double fears, one that theſe Propoſitions of Accommodation was but an Artifice for retarding the preparations, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which we ſaw from the ſmalneſs of the Proviſions that we knew was in the City: The other, that in caſe a Treaty ſhould be agreed on in earneſt, it would be to our diſadvantage; in that it was unlikely, that after the diſgrace at <hi>Re,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be under the neceſſary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of leaping into that Port and Citadel, which their Arms could not batter; and therefore, upon theſe grounds, we reſolved to endeavour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Duke from hearkening thereunto.</p>
                              <p>When we ſought an opportunity to diſcourſe the Duke in this matter, he preventing it, told us, the eleventh of this Month, that he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended very well to what end the courteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of the <hi>French</hi> tended, that not to give place to them in courteſie, his Majeſty would alſo ſend back the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, which ſhould be conducted by Monſieur <hi>Dolbier.</hi> In the mean time, that we ſhould eſteem our ſelves entirely aſſured (and give the like to thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi>) that they would not come upon any thing which ſhall tend to a Treaty, until that by ſome notable Exploit they ſhould put themſelves into a condition to do

                              <p>It was not a little ſatisfaction to us to hear him ſpeak in this manner; and above all, when the next day he made us an Overture, to preſent us to the Council, and to expreſs our juſt fears with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, that upon the noiſe which might be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of an Accommodation, our Common Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs might receive prejudice. And thus we have given you a Narrative of the diſcourſe it ſelf.</p>
                              <p>The 13th, we carried him our Memorial, which having approved, he rendezvouſed us next day in his Chamber, where about four in the Evening he came to us himſelf, and brought us into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but before he did it, he held a diſcourſe which filled us full of thoughts, advertiſing us not to be aſtoniſhed, if any ſhould enquire what we had to offer to his Majeſty in conſideration of our demanding his aſſiſtance; and above all, what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance we could give the King, if he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf in our further aſſiſtance, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould not be carried to a particular Treaty: As to himſelf, he was far from any ſuch thoughts; yet nevertheleſs, to ſerve us the more profitably, he deſired to know of us what he ſhould ſay to them, in caſe they ſhould propoſe any ſuch thing; and above all, what judgment we ſhould make of an Over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 <fw>1628. March.</fw> This Propoſition, notwithſtanding the Dukes Artifice, was of a very ill reliſh to us, and fearing that a ſudden Anſwer could not be ſo well framed, as that it would not prejudice us, whether in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too reſerved, which might diſguſt them, and retard the ſending of ſuccours, or in yielding too much beyond our Inſtructions, in ſuch ſort, as we ſhould be diſowned. We told him in general, that we could give all aſſurance that <hi>Rochel</hi> would never deny any reaſonable Overtures, for giving all juſt contentment to his Majeſty therein; but as to that which was upon particulars, we moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him, that as it had pleaſed him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to couch our deſires in writing, that it would likewiſe pleaſe him, to let us be anſwered in the ſame manner; to the end, that agreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves upon that which hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, that which we have to ſay may be the better digeſted.</p>
                              <p>Having teſtified his approbation hereof, he led us from thence into the Guilded Chamber, where the King was in full Council; before whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kneeled, and by his Command ſtanding up, Monſieur <hi>David</hi> repreſented in brief, that which we had more at large done in writing, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he preſented.</p>
                              <p>The King having taken it, gave it us again, and commanded us to read it to him, which we did with a loud and diſtinct voice, to the end that all might hear it, and was of this Tenure.</p>

                              <p>It is true, that Peace is deſirable above all things, and the City, for which they act, have an ardent paſſion for it, eſpecially being but newly delivered from the miſeries of two Wars ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</p>
                              <p>But the queſtion is, whether the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture conſidered, that which is propoſed is the true means to arrive at it; and whether, in the contrary, there is not cauſe to fear, that it is a ſnare extended for their ruine; which (if it pleaſe not his Majeſty to provide againſt) they ſee it moſt inevitable, making no doubt but this Negotiation draws with it theſe neceſſary conſequences.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, That though it may not ſlacken the true and good affection of his Majeſty, whereof they have an entire confidence, yet it may at leaſt the diligence of my Lords, his Miniſters, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for their ſuccours, conſidering that the Treaty coming towards a concluſion, the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for it will not (without doubt) be wanting, in deſigningly giving all imaginable hopes, which out of frugality may retard preparations; and now the leaſt delay will be their ruine, conſidering the condition in which they find themſelves.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, The news of Treating being noiſed, will certainly keep at home thoſe who prepare themſelves to take Horſe ſo ſoon as the <hi>Spring</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there being nothing more imprudent, than to put on Harneſs, when Peace is ready to be made.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, The bruit of a Treaty will indanger

                              <p>Fourthly, The worſt is, that during this delay, thoſe who beſiege their City, will with eaſe build all their Forts, and finiſh their Line on the Land ſide, aſſemble their Naval Army, which is not yet in a good condition; they will work at the <hi>Digue</hi> (or Bank) which they have begun, without looſing one moment, and at ſhutting the paſſage by Sea, and inacceſſibly imbarraſs their Haven: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which remained in the City, after their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his Majeſties Army, will be preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. In brief, the Affairs are in ſuch a ſtate, that the opportunity of relieving them being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all the Forces of <hi>Europe</hi> will not be able to do any thing, and then conſequently, the Treaty now propoſed will vaniſh; his Majeſty will be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the City which hath ingaged with him, will neceſſarily be forced to render, and ſubmit to the rage of a Victorious and irritated Maſter.</p>
                              <p>As his Majeſty knows well how to judge of the validity of theſe Reaſons and Conſequences, ſo they ſupplicate him in all humility, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the practices that may have been uſed to the contrary, he will provide that there may be no ſlackning, in any kind, of the neceſſary diligence for preparing the relief which it hath pleaſed him to promiſe them: And ſince the Convoy of Men and Victuals is almoſt ready, by the great care that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> High-Admiral hath taken, it would pleaſe him to command the whole Navy

                  <p>Leaving him, it was matter of great joy to us, that the Duke took no more notice of Hoſtages, or receiving the Armies into the City; and that without being obliged to any debate with the Commiſſioners, our Articles were received.</p>
                  <p>The 28th <hi>ditto,</hi> receiving advice that there was a competent quantity of Proviſions at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> we waited upon the Duke, to beg of him, that the Earl of <hi>Denby</hi> might depart the next day; and that the Sieur <hi>Dehinſe,</hi> our Collegue, might, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it was agreed upon, accompany him in his Voyage, and have the honour to receive the Commands of the King, and his own.</p>
                  <p>He carried us immediately to the King, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us with theſe Expreſſions; <hi>I underſtand that the Earl of</hi> Denby <hi>will ſet ſail without delay; take not that which he carries at preſent for a ſuccour, it is but for a refreſhment, to the end to give courage to your City, until time will permit a more puiſſant aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> And after a little pauſe, for fear that the word <hi>Time</hi> would not be taken by us according to his intention; <hi>I mean,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the ſeaſon, and ſo ſoon as the Spring ſhall be come:</hi> To which having returned him moſt humble thanks, he ſaid yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Be aſſured, that I will aſſiſt you ſo powerfully,

                        <fw>1628.

As to your Articles that you communicated to me yeſterday, the King likes them well, and goes now to have them ratified in Council, and cauſe the Confirmation thereof to be delivered to you.</p>
                  <p>Very much contented with theſe good words, we withdrew, and the next morning heard that the Earl of <hi>Denby</hi> prepared for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Sieur <hi>Dehinſe,</hi> our Collegue, to begin his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thither.</p>

Hereupon they reſolved not to loſe time; and before it was too late, to ſeek the Kings Grace, under the beſt Conditions they could, and in ſuch ſort, as they ſhould not know it came from them; and as they were in pain how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves in it, they concluded they could not better do it, than by making uſe of Sieur <hi>de la Leu,</hi> who ſome days before had deſired permiſſion to retire out of the City, and had obtained a ſafe Conduct of the King for it; and gave order to <hi>John Godfrey,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Sieur <hi>du Richard,</hi> to go to him, and deſire him, in their names, to accept the Commiſſion; which Sieur <hi>Godfrey</hi> did the next morning, going to Sieur <hi>de la Leu,</hi> who accepted of it, and agreed, that if there were any hopes on the Kings ſide to obtain a Peace under good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he would within a day ſend a Trumpet, if under paſſable, and not too advangeous, a Drum; and if he could not obtain anything, he would not ſend either one, or the other; but when he had run the adventure of loſing his life, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the City, giving them an account of what he had done.</p>
                  <p>This being agreed upon, and reported by the ſaid <hi>Godfrey</hi> to the Mayor, and Council of War, they ordered that <hi>de la Leu</hi> ſhould go from the City on <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning, by ſix a Clock, whilſt people were at Church, that he might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by any perſon, fearing that if they ſaw him go out, his Enemies would ſtir up the people againſt him, to do him ſome miſchief; and in the mean time to make ſhew of good news, and gave out, that there ſhould be given a Chain of Gold to the ſaid <hi>Vidault,</hi> to the end, that that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the Kings Camp, the management of

                  <p>Before the Mayor diſmiſſed the Council, he made them all take an Oath upon the Bible, that they would not either directly or indirectly buy any Proviſions whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army ſhould be at the Head of the Bay, fearing that that would diſcover to the people, that the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army (finding themſelves too weak to force the <hi>Digue,</hi> and enter the City with relief) would retire, and leave them as a Prey; and thereby not only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Treaty which they deſired to have by the means of Sieur <hi>de la Leu,</hi> but even put all the City into a Conſternation.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Tueſday,</hi> at the hour deſigned, the Sieur <hi>de la Leu</hi> went away unobſerved, ſave by a very few, and about three in the Evening (whether it was from his Interceſſion, as he had promiſed, or from other cauſe, is not known) a Trumpet preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf at the Fort <hi>Tadon,</hi> but one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that commanded there, cauſed them to ſhoot at him, without ſuffering him to finiſh his ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a Drummer his beating, whoſe Drum he broke; nor did they advertiſe the Mayor of their coming, he and many others being full of wrath againſt the Mayor, and Council, for not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to them the Letter, nor tell them why they had ſent Sieur <hi>de la Leu</hi> out of the Town; they came even ſo high, as to accuſe them of deſigning by him to make a particular Peace for themſelves, and abandon the reſt to the mercy and diſcretion of their Enemies, inſomuch, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to inſinuate ſomething of the Letter to ſome of the moſt inraged, for they cryed, that they believed that <hi>Godfrey</hi> had done it, and that

                  <p>So ſoon as the ſaid <hi>Vidault</hi> was come into <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> the Mayor cauſed Signals by Fire to be made from the Towers of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> of the Chain, and from the Lanthorn, to advertiſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army of his arrival; and in the morning, they fixed Enſigns upon the ſaid Towers, which were to remain there until the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army ſhould return into <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>The 18th, betwixt two and three a Clock Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet ſet ſail for <hi>England,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been eight days in the Road, at the Head of the Bay, without making any attempt, or Eſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend any relief into <hi>Rochel,</hi> which greatly dejected the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and put them in great pain and perplexity; nevertheleſs they reſolved to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the greateſt Extremity, before they would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to that end, bought one of another all ſorts of Proviſions; and that they might hold out the longer, retrenched their Ordinary to the moyety of that which they had accuſtomed to eat;

At firſt there was many died of this Diſeaſe; but a Phyſitian of the City, called <hi>Matthias Goyer,</hi> a knowing and experienced man in his Art, adviſed a Remedy which they had uſed in another ſickneſs ſuccesfully, and found the ſame as to this: It was Muſtard in Herbs, of which the Hillocks in the Fens afforded as great quantities as was needful, the which they bruiſed in a Mortar, and mingled it with White-Wine, and gave the quantity of an ordinary Glaſs thereof in the morning faſting; and though this Medicine neither wrought by Stool, or Urin, or cauſed any other effects which appeared, it nevertheleſs healed infallibly in eight or ten days. At firſt ſome would have concealed this Remedy for the Phyſitians profit, as indeed it was enough to have made him rich; but he ſaid he would not make the Publick Calamity the means of his inrichment; and that, ſince God as by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration had diſcovered this ſecret to him, he would give the Receipt of it <hi>gratis</hi> to every one, as he alſo did, and therein merited much from the Publick, and ſaved the lives of a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Thoſe that were at the Guard made ſcruple of receiving it; but having advertiſed the Mayor of it, he came accompanied with thoſe of his Council, to whom he read the Letter; and then ſaid with a loud voice to the Drummer (to the end that all thoſe that were there might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Anſwer he gave) <hi>That they were not upon the point of Rendering or Treating, and that they had Proviſions beyond what they were made believe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that within eight or fifteen days they hoped to be relieved both by Sea and Land from</hi> England, <hi>and that they had no other Anſwer to give.</hi>

                  <p>The 14th, with the Evening-tide, and betwixt two and three after Dinner, the <hi>Digue</hi> was beat upon with a very great and impetuous South-Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, in ſuch ſort, as it was almoſt totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the Ships walled up, removed from their place, the Engines and Bridges broken to pieces, and part of the Wrack drive within the Chain, with a Bark of 25 or 30 Tun, which greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and kept them in good hopes, that thence forward the like Storms, and ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would undo more in one Tide, than they could remake in many Months.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day an Artiſan, called <hi>Pierre du Bourg,</hi> fled hither ſome years ſince for refuge, was hanged in the <hi>Caſtle-yard,</hi> for holding Intelligence with the Beſiegers, and was diſcovered by his own Son of eleven or twelve years old, whoſe Innocency he made uſe of to carry his Letters to a certain place, whither thoſe without came for them. Upon the Rack he accuſed divers Inhabitants, but at the Gibbet confeſſed, that the torment of the Rack made him ſay more than he knew, and that they were Innocent of that which he had laid to their Charge: This ſaved them, otherwiſe they had run the ſame Adventure as he, their Proceſs being already well advanced.</p>
                  <p>The 24th, the Deputies in <hi>England</hi> ſeeing that the preparations that were made for the relief of <hi>Rochel</hi> went but ſlowly forward, made to the King ſitting in his Council a free and preſſing Harangue, by Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> as followeth.</p>

We know not, Sir, how to conceal it, the ſenſe we have of its being at its laſt gaſp, puts us into diſpair, ſeeing that the ſuccours which your Majeſty hath made us hope would be ready, hath been deferred from day to day, for many Weeks together. Sir, the City of <hi>Rochel</hi> did by us beg of you to receive them into your Protection, and you as ſolemnly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to it, and ſince that they have had at divers times all the aſſurances poſſible, as well from your own mouth, as the Hand of your Majeſty, that you would never abandon them; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a Miracle of Conſtancy, they have held out hitherto (a whole year) contending with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of a moſt ghaſtful Famine, that they might thereby give leiſure to your Majeſty to ſend them the ſuccours you pleaſed to promiſe them; and thus conſtant were they, even when all <hi>Europe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they ought to have deſpaired, in that after having had relief, as they thought, ſeveral days in their ſight, it returned without effecting or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any thing: and though our Enemies

After all this, Sir, ſhall it be recorded in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Reign, that they periſhed in your hands, without reaping any other fruit of the good will your Majeſty hath profeſſed towards them, or of the aſſurance they have therein relied upon, than the rendering them irreconcileable to their King, from whom otherwiſe they might have found Grace. Pardon, Sir, this, from a People that finds themſelves upon the Threſhold of their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, if they cannot avoid ſighs that may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent in your preſence. It is ordinary with thoſe that are near their end, to finiſh their lives with groans; and ſuch will be our caſe, if after the precedent neglects, there follows the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. In the Name of God, Sir, whilſt there is yet reſting to us any Breath, and before we totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, command that your ſuccours be haſtened to our aſſiſtance; and provided that diligence be yet uſed, we will remain Caution to your Majeſty, with the peril of our Heads, that they will arrive time enough to ſave us. And as to the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that ſome will ſuggeſt to be in it, permit us, we beſeech you, Sir, to tell you freely, that that Opinion proceeds either from fear, or want of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and that beſides the contrary Report that ſome unſuſpected have made, thereof to your Majeſty. It is not tobe thought that our City,

But we are ready, if it pleaſe your Majeſty to permit it, to take upon us the firſt Adventure of the execution, to the end to juſtifie the ſincerity of our proceedings to all the World; and that it may not be imputed to us, that we are prodigal of the blood of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects to ill purpoſe, or that we will ſpare our own: No, Sir, there is no impoſſibility in the caſe, as is feigned; but the only cauſe of our fears proceeds from the continual neglects from one day to another, and from one Week to the next, which make our hopes recoil. After there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of your Fleet, we comforted our ſelves with the promiſe that was made us from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that it ſhould ſet ſail again within fifteen days; and when more than twenty were paſt, they added thereunto fourteen: After that, divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglects, in ſuch ſort, as make up now two Months compleat. Good God, Sir, time ſeems long with them that have not Bread; we know well the good Inclinations that your Majeſty hath for us; as alſo we have had moſt certain proofs of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (your High-Admiral) paſſionate applying himſelf for us, and the ſame of the Lords of your Council; but ſhall we not be excuſable, if ſeeing the effects croſſed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, we entertain jealouſies that your Majeſty is not well ſerved, and that there is ſome hidden

It is ordinary with men in miſery to be ſuſpitious, and poſſibly we are injuriouſly ſo; and indeed we do not know any perſon upon whom to determine our diffidence, nor do we intend the calling to mind any thing that is paſſed; for for ever, Sir, may that remain buried in perpetual Oblivion: and as for the time to come, let thoſe at leaſt to whom your Majeſty ſhall give your Commands, anſwer your kindneſs to us with their affection and diligence, in putting your Fleet to Sea without any more delay, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us out of the Jaws of Death. If upon this occaſion, Sir, you diſcern thoſe that ſerve you faithfully from others (if there be any ſuch) let your Majeſty hold it indiſputable (if it pleaſe you) that all thoſe, who under any pretext whatſoever, ſhall counſel the leaſt neglect, do it from an evil intention, there being none that are ignorant of the horrible neceſſities of our City, and that one day of delay may be its ruine: Have conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, Sir, we beſeech you, by the tears and pitiful cryes of more than twelve thouſand lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Souls, whom Hunger devours, and who are all ready to periſh by the intereſt of more than a Million of others, who without doubt will ſee themſelves buried under our Ruines, and will find the Knife at their Throats the next day after we are loſt: By the glory of your Scepter, under the Sanctuary of which we are come to put our ſelves, and which it hath pleaſed you to tender us for our ſecurity; by the Magnificent Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> which obligeth your Majeſty to relieve thoſe that are oppreſſed out of a hatred to it: In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Upon this they conteſted, and each made their Party; but the Mayor prevailing, the Aſſiſtant of the Judge Criminal, with three or four others of the Seat of Juſtice, gave a ſecret Sentence againſt him, and the Council of War condemned them in twelve thouſand <hi>Livres</hi> penalty, payable by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them for the whole, his remedy reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt the others.

                                 <fw>1628. Aug.</fw> what they deſired of them. The one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finding themſelves ſurpriſed by this queſtion, asked leave to go and ſee who it was, and ſpeak to them; and to the end that the Council might be informed of all that might be ſaid and done, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their diſcourſe, they choſe from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of the Council, <hi>Benjamin Veronneau</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, to aſſiſt at the ſaid Conference; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun with imbracements, made particularly by the ſaid Sieur <hi>de la Fitte</hi> of the ſaid <hi>de la Goute,</hi> and <hi>Toupet,</hi> with whom he had had long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Sieur <hi>de la Fitte</hi> began to ſpeak in this ſort: <hi>Gentlemen, the King being moſt well informed of your Fidelity towards him, and that you have the</hi> Flower de Luces <hi>ſo impreſſed upon your hearts, that you have rejected all the Propoſitions that men could make you, for ſhaking off his Dominion, to ſerve another Prince, is the ſole ſubject of our Meſſage. Cardinal</hi> Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, <hi>who knoweth that I have ſome Acquaintance in your City, hath commanded me to endeavour to confer with ſome of you upon the ſubject of your miſery, to the end to prevent your ruine, which you ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by not ſeeking to your Prince (who is altogether good) for his Grace, when he would never refuſe it you, if you humble your ſelves to him: He knows that your Famine is great, that your Houſes are already full of dead Bodies for want of Bread, that the voice of dying perſons ſounds in your Streets, and that thoſe that have been moſt provident are not furniſhed until the firſt of</hi> September; <hi>it is your duty to ſave rather thoſe that are remaining, than to looſe them, becauſe they which remain are the moſt conſiderable; ſcarcity begun with the loweſt ſort, moſt ſubject to Rebellion; he had rather have your Hearts, than your Walls; and be aſſured, that if you are once reduced to his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102984:78"/>
                                    <fw>1628. Aug.</fw> ſervice, you will not any more depart from it. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or ſuſpect, that the King will take away your Religion, and that the Cardinal will perſwade the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing it the Kingdom; you are miſtaken, the King would be moſt eaſie, would you have confidence in him, and deſires to win you with ſweetneſs, without uſing violence. The experience of times paſſed doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonſtrate to</hi> France, <hi>that Religion is not to be planted with the Sword, and that it's God alone that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the Heart, and illuminates the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding with his knowledge. Think of it then whilſt there is time, and periſh not, expecting Bread from</hi> England; <hi>thoſe People think not of you, and if they ſhould have a deſire to ſuccour you, they will not now be able to do it: The King hath a powerful Sea-Army to deſtroy all the force they can bring, and the</hi> Digue <hi>is in ſuch a condition, that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>will not dare to hazard the breaking of it with their Ships: I pray you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, have pity of your ſelves.</hi>

                              <p>This Diſcourſe being received with Applauſe by the aforeſaid Sieurs <hi>de la Goute, Toupet,</hi> and <hi>Veronneau,</hi> after a ſhort Diſcourſe full of Thanks, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their deſire of entering into the favour of their Prince, and that they were come thither to hear the Propoſitions and Overtures that would be made, that they might report them to the Council, and of their own good Intentions, they might aſſure his Majeſty, the Cardinal, and the Lords of the Council; and moſt earneſtly intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid Sieurs <hi>de la Fitte,</hi> and <hi>de Delon,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to them the Propoſitions: To which they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; they could not do that, having no order therein; but if the Inhabitants of the City would enter into a Treaty, it behoved them to do it with the Cardinal, who would be at the Fort <hi>de la Fons</hi>

Aug.</fw> when they ſhould deſire it; and that he might be near at hand, if they would give ſecurity for his coming within the Percullis of the Port <hi>Coigne,</hi> he would not refuſe it; provided, that as caution for his Perſon, they would give a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the moſt qualified Citizens to remain as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages, during the ſaid Treaty: And after this, the ſaid Sieurs <hi>de la Fitte,</hi> and <hi>de Delon,</hi> delivered divers Propoſitions, but, as they ſaid, without Commiſſion. The firſt was, that ſince the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> would not upon any account whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their obedience to <hi>France,</hi> according as they had teſtified to thoſe that would have drawn them to it, they ought to cheriſh the Honour of their Prince, and treating with him, give ſome marks of their ſubmiſſion to his Majeſty: That Subjects ought not (in any time) to think to treat with their King as Equals, eſpecially when he ſees them at the laſt gaſp. You ought to think of ſome Overtures which may content both Parties, ſuch as may evidence the humility of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and advance the glory of their Prince; they ſhould of themſelves demoliſh the Baſtion of the Port <hi>Coigne,</hi> which being done, the King will retire without entering the City with any of his Army, either by that way, or any other. To which was replied by <hi>Meſſieur de la Goute, Toupet,</hi> and <hi>Veronneau,</hi> that if all the inhabitants of the City would have as much confidence as they in the bounty of the King, and word of his Principal Miniſters, their Propoſition might be received; but that the City being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of perſons timerous and fearful, they had no hopes of perſwading them that they could be in ſecurity againſt the Army that beſieged them, after there ſhould be ſuch a breach in their Walls,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102984:79"/>
                                 <fw>1628. Aug.</fw> and begged of them not to believe that they could be ſo ſimple, as to make ſuch a Propoſition, and much leſs to make it valid, and ſtrengthen it, by alledging their reaſons. After this, the ſaid Sieurs came to a ſecond Overture, which was, that the King ſhould enter the City with two hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by the Port <hi>Coigne,</hi> without going into the Streets; and going along the Ramparts, return by the Port S. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> This ſecond, as more ſweet, was better hearkened unto, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs not received by the Sieurs <hi>de la Goute, Toupet,</hi> and <hi>Veronneau,</hi> who relying upon the knowledge they had of the ſaid Inhabitants, replied, that to demand the entry of the King alone, were as much as to demand the entry of all his Army; for that there is not one in the City, who ſeeing his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in it, would not think rather to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him, and to beg his pardon, than to give order that there ſhould but two hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come in, when upon ſuch an occaſion there may be ſome Lords with the King, who againſt his good intentions, exceeding the promiſe given, would do that which he in no wiſe would have done, perſwading the people that they could not have any ſecurity in their diffidence of him. This Exception being alſo judged reaſonable, they came to a third Overture, which was, that in all caſes to ſhew, as well to the Kingdom, as to Strangers, that the King had the advantage of his Subjects of <hi>Rochel,</hi> they would demoliſh one of the three Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the Haven of the City unto the height only of the Walls. This Propoſition was found ſo moderate, that the Sieurs <hi>de la Goute, Toupet,</hi> and <hi>Veronneau</hi> anſwered, that if his Majeſty would, be content with the demoliſhing of all the three Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102984:79"/>
                                 <fw>1628. Aug.</fw> and would ſolely depend thereupon, they would ſubmit thereunto, without expecting more. After this Conference, which was three hours at leaſt, both Parties retired, reſolving to report each to their Principals, what had paſſed in this Interview, endeavouring to bring things to an Accommodation, and to ingage in a Treaty. And indeed the Sieurs <hi>de la Goute, Toupet,</hi> and <hi>Veron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau,</hi> having in general made report to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, (who continued ſitting, expecting them) they approved of what had paſſed, and appointed after Dinner to conſider thereof; when after having heard more particularly from the Sieurs <hi>de la Goute, Toupet,</hi> and <hi>Veronneau,</hi> what had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and their Anſwers, they reſolved of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in a Treaty; but the manner of it was found ſo greatly difficult, that in the end, by plurality of Voices, they deferred it ſome days, to give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one time to conſider with himſelf of the beſt and convenienteſt method and means.</p>
                              <p>The day after, by order of the Council of War, Sieur <hi>Paul Mervalt</hi> cauſed to be put upon the Ports, and the Detachments from the Port <hi>Coigne,</hi> and upon the Caſements of the ſaid Ports, upon the Port and Herſe, or Portcullis of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,</hi> upon the Ports and Bridge of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and of the two Mills, 230 great Bullets of Battery, that in caſe of any attempts to ſcale the Walls, to caſt down upon them that ſhould ſtorm them.</p>
                              <p>The 16th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> betwixt two and three a Clock in the Afternoon, came within a Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the Port <hi>Coigne</hi> a Herald with two Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, to ſummon the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King, to whom no anſwer was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                  <p>The third of <hi>Octob.</hi> new Stile, about ſeven or eight in the morning, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earl of <hi>Linſey,</hi> ſet ſail, and ſeemed to give order to advance betwixt the two Points, but ſtayed there two hours, with ſome light approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on each ſide, but nevertheleſs without coming to blows; nor did they any thing more, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge many Cannon-ſhot, and ſend ſome Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, without any effect, and after this retired, to the great trouble of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who believed they ought to have done better, for they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in their hopes, ſwallowed the Proviſions brought them by the Fleet.</p>
                  <p>During this ſhadow of Attacque, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> diſcharged many Cannon-ſhot from their Steeples, Towers, and Batteries on that ſide, of which it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102984:88"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> was reported in the Evening, that one ſhot from the Tower of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> killed four Perſons of Quality on the ſide of <hi>Coureille:</hi> In the City was alſo killed with one ſhot, coming from the Gally, the Sieur <hi>Gedeon Mignonneau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth of <hi>Octob.</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army returned a ſecond time, as if it intended to attacque the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the King, but did no more than the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, diſcharge ſome Cannon-ſhot, and ſet ſix of their Fire-ſhips on fire; but being a Calm, and the Wind at <hi>North,</hi> they effected nothing, but burnt behind the Points of the Head of the Bay, and <hi>Coureille,</hi> unto the Plain of <hi>Angulin.</hi> This ſaddened the hearts of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> greatly, and took from them (by their ill beginning) almoſt all hopes of being delivered by this Army.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh, the Sieur <hi>Paul Mervault</hi> cauſed to be caſt in <hi>Rochel</hi> four Culverines, one whereof failed, the other three proving good.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day the King ſent a Gentleman into the City, to know if they would come to any Treaty of Peace; but he returned the next day without doing any thing, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> refuſing all particular Treaties, and making again the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned difficulty of knowing how to addreſs to the King.</p>
                  <p>The eighth <hi>ditto,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army made a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, accompanied with a Cannon-ſhot, upon the arrival of Sieur <hi>de la Land du Lac,</hi> which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> anſwered with the contrary Signal, of a Fire upon the Tower at the Chain, and with a Cannon-ſhot.</p>

                  <p> Beſides this Letter, the Meſſenger that brought it, told Wonders of the Preparations that were made againſt the next High-tide; and above all, that they had three Ships to uſe as a Mine to blow up the <hi>Digue</hi> with, in each of which there were many thouſands of Powder, from which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected great effect for breaking the <hi>Digue,</hi> and entirely opening the paſſage.</p>
                  <p>This cauſed ſome particular perſons (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging that with the ſaid High-water Victuals would come into the City) to make on the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth, a publick ſale of Corn, Biſquet, and all ſorts of Proviſions; and there was found one amongſt others, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Buſhels of Corn, and as many of Wheat, ten Quintals of Biſquet, twelve Buſhels of Beans, and as many of Peaſe, ſix Buſhels of Fitches, one Bale of Rice, twelve Quintals of dried Fiſh of <hi>Virginy,</hi> and ſix Barrels of Butter. As this did well with many, ſo it killed a great many others, whoſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs being debilitated by ill nouriſhment, and the little that they had in a long time eaten, were left without heat for digeſtion, in ſuch ſort, that having eaten greedily, they fainted away, as I have ſeen many.</p>
                  <p>The 14th <hi>ditto,</hi> with the Evening-tide, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Army made a Signal of Fire, upon the arrival of a Souldier that the Mayor had ſent, upon which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> made immediately another in the Tower of the Chain, and from the Lanthorn.</p>
                  <p>The 15th <hi>ditto,</hi> in the night, came into <hi>Rochel</hi> a Souldier, who reported, that my Lord <hi>Montague</hi> was come into the Camp to treat of a Peace with the King; and after having been well received of his Majeſty, and Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102984:89"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> thence into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army: He ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſo, that a Cannon-ſhot from the Steeple of S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> fell in the Fort <hi>Louis,</hi> over againſt the King, who having at that time the ſaid <hi>Montague</hi> with him, they were by it covered with duſt, which was the cauſe that betwixt three and four a Clock in the Evening, there was many Cannon-ſhot diſcharged from the ſaid Fort againſt the City: And this accident obliged the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Prayers every day at their Sermons, for the preſervation of his Majeſty from all evil.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the Mayor and his Council ſeeing that the Spring-tide was paſſed, without the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Army attempting any thing, the weather having been always very calm, ſo that they could not hope for relief ſooner than with the next Spring-tide, aſſembled the Council in the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to the end to conſider how to govern themſelves for the time to come. Amongſt other things they ordained, that there ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in all the Companies of the City, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to make ſearch in all Houſes to ſee what Corn there was, or other Proviſions, and to leave thereof, in each Houſe where any was found, for fifteen days, or three Weeks at the moſt, and to take the reſt to diſtribute to thoſe that had none. The ſearch being made, there was found in all but 150 Buſhels of Corn of all Grain, each having done of themſelves, at the arrival of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> what now the Council would do, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Parents and Friends with what they had over, expecting nothing leſs than to ſee the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Fleet a Month in the Road without doing any thing.</p>
                  <p>This little Corn that was found, was reſerved
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102984:90"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> for the nouriſhment of the Souldiers, who with the inhabitants were like Anatomies, and by little and little died away. And it is moſt obſervable what befell two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers, who finding that they could do no more, went together to the Houſe of a Joyner, to beſpeak each their Coſſin for the next day by eight in the morning: he at firſt refuſed it, believing they mocked him, as thinking himſelf more waſted with Famine than the Souldiers; have you not ſtrength, ſaid they, to work? and preſſing of him, and paying him in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, the gain made him undertake it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and in their preſence, began to work, and finiſhed theſe two Coffins, and came at the time they appointed with them, when he ſaw the ſame Evening one die, and the other the next day, betwixt ten and eleven in the morning.</p>
                  <p>The 17th of <hi>October,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Arnault</hi> came to the Port S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> to Parley; there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to hear him the Sieurs <hi>Viette, Riffault, Journault,</hi> and <hi>Mocquay:</hi> he returned the next day, and conferred long with them, but could not conclude any thing.</p>
                  <p>The 18th, in the morning, the Mayor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſent out <hi>Chardeuine</hi> to go to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; but as he would have paſſed the Line, he received a Muſquet-ſhot in his ſhoulder, which obliged him to return to the City.</p>
                  <p>The 19th, in the morning before day, the Mayors Lodgings were ſet on fire, and he had run an adventure of being burnt, had it not been that one that paſſed that way diſcovered it, crying, <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> which brought together the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who quenched it readily, before it had time to burn more than part of the doors, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102984:90"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> blacken the Planks of the Shop: It was believed that this proceeded from ſome Inhabitants, who deſpairing of relief, deſired the rendition of the Town.</p>
                  <p>Now the Famine increaſed dreadfully, nothing being left, the greateſt number having in three Months time not known what Bread was, nor any thing of ordinary Proviſions; Fleſh of Horſes, Aſſes, Mules, Dogs, Cats, Rats and Mice, were all eaten up; there was no more Herbs or Snails left in the Fields, ſo that their recourſe was to Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hides of Oxen, skins of Sheep, Cinamon, Caſſia, Liquoriſh out of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shops, <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Colewort frigaſed, Bread of Straw made with a little Sugar, Flower of Roots, <hi>Iriſh</hi> Powder, Gelly of the skins of Beaſts and Sheep, Horns of Deer beaten to Powder, old Buff-Coats, ſoles of Shooes, Boots, Aprons of Leather, Belts for Swords, old Pockets, Leather Points, Parchment, Wood beaten in a Mortar, Plaiſter, Earth, Dung (which I have ſeen with my eyes) Carrion, and Bones that the Dogs had gnawn, and indeed all that came in their ſight, though ſuch food gave rather death than ſuſtenance, or prolongation of life, from whence there paſſed not a day that there died not two or three hundred, or more perſons, in ſuch ſort, that not only the Church-yards, but even the Houſes, Streets, and out-parts of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were in a little time filled with dead bodies, without having other Sepulchres than the places where they fell, the living not having ſo much ſtrength as to throw them into the Ditch, even many went to die in the Church yards.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Calamities and Miſeries, ſome, who having reſerved hidden Proviſion, ſold them
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102984:91"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> under-hand at an exceſſive price, to wit, the Peck of Corn (which is the eighth part of the Buſhel of the City) for the ſum of two hundred <hi>Livers,</hi> which is twelve pound ten ſhillings <hi>Starling;</hi> a Biſquet, which ſcarce weighed ſeven or eight ounces, for ten or twelve Crowns, which is forty five or fifty four ſhillings <hi>Starling;</hi> a Calf a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Livers,</hi> which is ſeventy five pound <hi>Starling,</hi> with ſome reſerve for the ſeller; a Sheep, from three to five hundred <hi>Livers,</hi> at eighteen pence <hi>Starling</hi> the <hi>Liver,</hi> and all the reſt, after the ſame rate; and yet they thought themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who by the Interceſſion of Friends, could get any thing at theſe Rates. In the mean time, it was a marvellous thing, that the neceſſities being ſuch, and the Mortality ſo great, there was no Confederation or grumbling in the City, neither by the common people, nor others, to oblige the Mayor and his Council to Capitulate, but all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be led to their deaths without complaints and murmuring, teſtifying their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and contentment, which ſhews the great influence that Religion and Liberty have upon the ſpirits of men. As to thoſe without, I mean the Kings Army, it was alſo marvellous, that having advice of the lamentable and frightful neceſſity, and the extreme feebleneſs that the place was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto, they never attempted the Storming of it, when it was impoſſible for them within to have reſiſted, having no ſtrength left them, not ſo much as to traverſe their Cannon, or to Toll their Great Bell for the Sermon; and when they ſet their Guards, they found often half of them dead in the morning; and the like by their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, in ſo much, that many Nights paſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102984:91"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> having any perſons in the greateſt part of the Courts of Guard, ſo that the leaſt attempt had carried the City; but God looked upon us in mercy, and prepared the King to exerciſe towards us the Wonders and Miracles of his Mercy and Clemency.</p>
                  <p>During the horrour of this Famine, as there was Examples of Cruelty, there was alſo many of great Charity, in a free and voluntary diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of their Over-plus, as others had done of their Plenty, for inriching of themſelves; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially Sieur <hi>Thinault,</hi> a Merchant, and one of my Uncles, called Sieur <hi>Duprat,</hi> who having in their Houſe a moſt great quantity of Wheat, and other Corn, ſold not one grain, but diſtributed it to thoſe whom they judged to be in want, for to repay them only when God ſhould reſtore them to peace and ability.</p>
                  <p>Others there were who diſtributed Charity ſo in ſecret, as the Authors thereof were never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and amongſt others, I had knowledge of one which ſeems to me moſt remarkable: <hi>Le Sieur de la Goute,</hi> a Honorary Advocate to the King, had a Siſter, Widow to a Merchant called <hi>Proſni,</hi> who being a very religious and charitable Woman, when the Famine begun to be more ſharp than ordinary, aſſiſted freely the Poor; her Siſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, Wife to the Sieur <hi>de la Goute,</hi> being of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother humour, reproved her for it, asking her in choler, what ſhe would do when ſhe had given all away; to which ſhe anſwered, My Siſter, the Lord will provide for me. The Famine increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the Siege continuing, this poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, who had four Children, finding her ſelf in a ſtreight, having no Proviſions at all left, went to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102984:92"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> her Siſter for relief; but inſtead of comforting her, ſhe reproached her, telling her, ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided well to be ſo reduced with all her great Faith, and fair words, <hi>that the Lord will provide for me;</hi> and that in good time he would provide for her. This poor Womans Heart was wounded with theſe words, and returning to her Houſe much troubled, reſolved to take death patiently: Being come home, her Children met her with great joy, as formerly they uſed to do, but now told her, that a Man, whom they did not know, it being late, knocked at the door, and as ſoon as it was opened, threw in a Sack of Wheat of about a Buſhel (which is near two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Buſhels) and then went readily away, without ſaying any thing to them: This poor Woman, though hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe her own eyes, went preſently out of doors, and with the greateſt ſpeed ſhe could (in her famiſhed condition) run to her Siſter-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, and told her with a ſtrong voice, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw her, <hi>My Siſter, the Lord hath provided for me;</hi> and then returned, without diſcourſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her. By the means of this unexpected relief, coming ſo opportunely, ſhe ſpun out the time until the Kings entrance, and never knew to whom ſhe was obliged for this good and merciful act.</p>
                  <p>The 21th <hi>ditto,</hi> betwixt ſeven and eight a Clock in the Evening, the Kings Naval Army ſent four Fire-ſhips againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which obliged ſome Ships to cut their Cables, but others defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and turned them aſide, by the help of their Dragontins and Shalloops.</p>
                  <p>The 23th <hi>ditto,</hi> with the morning-tide, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Army ſet ſail, coming to the Palliſade, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102984:92"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> behind the Point of <hi>Coureille,</hi> but without making any attempt, contented themſelves with making ſome unprofitable Cannon-ſhot.</p>
                  <p>The 25th in the night, the Mayors Houſe was again ſet on fire with dry branches cut from Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, well prepared with Sulphur, Pitch, Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and other combuſtible things, but it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcovered, and as ſoon extinguiſhed: And further, the ſame night, two hours before day, twenty or thirty Souldiers ſet fire on the Port of <hi>Coigne,</hi> but thoſe that were on the Guard at the ſaid Port, put it out immediately.</p>
                  <p>The 26th, there came by Land into <hi>Rochel</hi> a Gentleman from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, who brought three Letters, one from the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> his Mother, the other two from Sieur <hi>Vincent;</hi> the one to the Mayor in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and the other to the Body of the City in general, by which they gave advice of all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; and above all, that my Lord <hi>Montague</hi> having communicated with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> for a Treaty of Peace, was gone Poſt for <hi>England,</hi> from whence they expected him every day; and intimated, that in the mean time they would procure a Paſs-port for two of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (their Deputies) to go to the Kings Camp to communicate with them, and from thence to go to them in the City, to the end that at the arrival of the ſaid <hi>Montague,</hi> all things might be diſpoſed to a good Peace; and that the General charged them to give this advice, and that in the mean time he was reſolved to attempt againſt the <hi>Digue,</hi> if the weather would ſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Immediatly after this Gent. was ſent back with his diſpatch to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, the Mayor aſſembled the Council in the Town Houſe, to conſider of what was neceſſary to be done, and after mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the matter contained in the aboveſaid Letters, the report of the ſaid Gentleman, the miſerable condition to which they were reduced, the great and extreme neceſſities which preſſed them, their great feebleneſs, ſuch as they were not ſufficient, nor capable to reſiſt the leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault their Enemies ſhould make, and the little or no appearance of being relieved by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had been there a Month with folded Arms, they concluded, that it was in vain to expect any longer relief from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or alſo from their Treaty, for that they ſhould be all dead before their Negotiator would return; and therefore, upon the whole, they reſolved to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King for his grace and mercy.</p>
                  <p>For that end, they took occaſion from a Letter that the Sieur <hi>Arnault</hi> had writ that day to the Sieur <hi>Fequiere,</hi> by the Drummer who brought him his Victuals, which repreſented to them the ſtrength of the <hi>Digue,</hi> and the little hopes they had of relief from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that a good Peace would be better for them got, by ſending to the King to receive them into his Grace. The ſaid Sieur <hi>Fequiere</hi> having communicated his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Mayor, they prayed him in his Anſwer to Sieur <hi>Arnault,</hi> to adviſe him to come the next morning to the City, and they would confer with him.</p>

                  <p>Now I hold my ſelf obliged in duty to impart unto the Publick a Narrative which came from Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s own particular Family, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the rendition, which is believed to have been compoſed either by one of his Secretaries, or poſſibly by himſelf, which may very well ſerve to illuſtrate that which follows, touching the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions granted the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and ſhew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and grounds upon which they were granted; the Tenour of which is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> underſtanding by Letters from Sieur <hi>Fequiere</hi> to Sieur <hi>Arnault</hi> his Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> deſired Paſs-ports to ſeek his Majeſties Grace (which he was pleaſed with) his firſt care was to give the King ready advice thereof, who received it with great joy, and immediately did the Cardinal the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to go to him to <hi>Souſay,</hi> where he aſſembled the Council, for to deliberate upon ſome Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under which they would receive the City, notwithſtanding their obſtinacy in their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                  <p>All agreed, that they had merited a moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Chaſtiſement, and that they ought to make them a Signal Example to all thoſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which might for the time to come have a thought of oppoſing the will of the King, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Revolts or Commotions in the Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>But when it came to be debated, though all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that the King might in Juſtice take the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt way, yet whether that would be moſt for his Grandeur and Glory, and moſt agreeable to the true Maxims of State, they were divided into

                     </gap>ers, to ſhew Grace to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal gathering the ſenſe of one and the other, without giving his Opinion, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to the King, to the end that he ſhould make a deciſion thereof; yet nevertheleſs tempered his diſcourſe ſo, as his inclinations might thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>Beginning with thoſe who were for making the City an Example of Juſtice, he ſaid, their advice was very well fortified, and poſſible that none can be rendered more deſerving puniſhment, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her obſtinacy, the trouble it hath a long time given his Majeſty, and that the Ruines of no place which the King hath demoliſhed to the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cry higher for teaching the people obedience to their Soveraigns that this; and that there is no Ramparts ſecure againſt Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe which held the middle Opinion, he extolled their Reaſons, and ſaid, that in ſuch Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, the puniſhment of the moſt Culpable was an awe upon Mutineers, and the pardoning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhewed the bounty of the Prince, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the obſtinacy of a Community in like caſes, as is ordinary with thoſe that deſpair not of mercy, of which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> was even then an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>But when he came to the advice of thoſe that concluded for a General Pardon, he inlarged and inſiſted very much upon their Reaſons: And firſt, he repreſented, as moſt conſiderable, that which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102984:94"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> they had ſuppoſed, that poſſibly there was never ſo Illuſtrious an occaſion as this preſented to any Prince, to ſignalize his Clemency, which is the vertue by which Kings approach neareſt to God, whoſe Image they are moſt in well doing, giving life, and not in deſtroying and exterminating it: Further, that the more culpable that <hi>Rochel</hi> was, and had given the King cauſe of great irritation, the more it would make his Magnanimity appear, in after overcoming the City with his Invincible Arms, reducing it to a naked ſubmiſſion to him, to ſurmount himſelf in pardoning it; in doing of which, the Celebrated Name of this City would proclaim his Glory thoroughout the World, and tranſmit it to Poſterity, ſhewing him thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as an incomparable Prince, be it in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in the moderate uſe of his Victories.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, he weighed the Reaſons they had alledged, drawn from <hi>Rochel</hi> it ſelf, who though it was culpable beyond what they could ſay, nevertheleſs the lives of ſo many thouſands as their faults had coſt, were ſufficient <hi>Victims</hi> to the Juſtice of his Majeſty, and interceded for the remainder of the miſerable People which might be left, which may be judged of by thoſe that are every day ſeen as Anatomies and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes about the Line; and indeed, true Images of Death, the ſight only whereof doth ſuffice to diſarm his Majeſty of all revenge, and though he had had a deſign to triumph over and conſume them, to change all his Irritation and Thundering into pity.</p>
                  <p>He added, that it ſeemed good that they ſhould alſo conſider of what had been alledged, and that though their Crimes were moſt great, and without
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102984:95"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> excuſe, yet they had not committed that offence which ought to exclude the people from all hopes of mercy, as if they had ſhaken off the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Soveraign, and ſubmitted to another Scepter: Indeed factious ſpirits made uſe of the danger of his Majeſties forcing their Religion, to deceive them into the adhering to the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> for the preſerving of their Priviledges; but his Majeſty knows, that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> made uſe only of that pretence to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that there were other reaſons which carried them to the undertaking of this War, for that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly informed that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> never intended to give themſelves up to them; which he knew as well by divers of his Servants which he had ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the City, as from his Confidents which he maintained in <hi>England,</hi> who had conſtantly writ him, that though they had every way aſſaulted the Fidelity of their Deputies, and deferred relief, to oblige them to offer themſelves to them, they would never hearken to it; and the perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this they received by the Packet, which one of their Pinnaces, coming from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> threw into the water, when at the paſſing of the <hi>Digue</hi> they thought they ſhould be taken: Their Treaty made with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and all their Negotiations being deciphered, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had highly Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, for getting Conditions to the prejudice of this Crown, they would never be brought to it; and defended themſelves therein, with all the conſtancy and firmneſs that their condition could bear: And therefore, though they are moſt Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, yet ſince they have preſerved their hearts and affections for <hi>France,</hi> it ſeems to invite his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102984:95"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> Majeſty to mercy, and not to uſe them as ſuch who would have ſhaken off the Yoke of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and offered the hand to another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, he inſiſted much upon reaſon of State, upon which this advice was founded, and preſſed the preſent Conſtitution of Affairs, to require that his Majeſty by a Signal example of Clemency, and an exact Capitulation, mutually agreed upon, ſhould endeavour to overcome the Arms of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and other rebellious Cities, who had all their eyes upon <hi>Rochel,</hi> for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſage that they ſhall meet with, they will conclude as to themſelves: ſuppoſe then that his Majeſty exerciſing rigour towards them, he makes the leaſt paultry Town ſtand out a Siege, and obſtinately reſiſt unto the laſt, were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to grant an abſolute Pardon to this City, whereby he may diſpoſe the reſt to beg the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his Majeſty, who by this means will in a little time ſee all his Country in peace, and may then purſue his deſigns againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Allies.</p>
                  <p>He added that which themſelves had alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that though in all appearance the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> were not able to do any more, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was not to believe, that they had deferred treating until the laſt morſel; and that as they had been three Months deceived in their Opinion, that they ſtill could not hold out any longer, it may be that thoſe that have the major Vote, and who fear their Heads, may prevail for hindering the rendition, and hold out yet ſome time, and the leaſt delay is of great conſequence, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Italy</hi> being very preſſing. Above
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102984:96"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> all, it behoves us much to conſider, that my Lord <hi>Montague,</hi> who was gone into <hi>England,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected back every day with the allowance of his King for the rendition of the City; and it will be infinitely more for his Majeſties glory, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Subjects into Grace, upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and voluntary ſubmiſſion to his Commands, than at the Interceſſion of a Stranger Prince; and therefore it imported them very much to prevent the ſaid <hi>Montague,</hi> to the end, that at his arrival he might find his Majeſty Triumphant in the place of his glorious Conqueſt; and that they might not be obliged in Conteſts, which otherwiſe they may have with him, touching the Conditions of this rendition, and to ingage in a further War with <hi>England,</hi> when their Affairs require the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the making of Peace with them.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſubſtance of that which Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> repreſented to his Majeſty, who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that having well weighed all circumſtances, he would deceive thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> in giving them cauſe to bleſs his entry into the City, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould have all the aſſurances poſſible given them for their Lives, Goods, and Religion; and that forgetting all their faults, they ſhould be treated as his other Subjects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they remained faithful for the time to come; but that he intended to demoliſh all their Walls, for taking from them the means of rendering themſelves at any other time miſerable, and that they ſhould not ſpeak any more of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which had hitherto inflamed them unto ſo high a degree.</p>
                  <p>This is the Contents of the above-mentioned Piece, which I eſteem worthy to be inſerted in this

                  </p>
                  <p>The 27th, the Mayor and Council being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, thoſe that had been ſent to the Sieur <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiere</hi> reported, that he thought it neceſiary for reaping the fruit of his Interceſſion, which they had deſired that they ſhould nominate ſome with whom he might communicate before the arrival of his Brother-in-law, who would not ſtay, as he hoped; which being approved of, they deputed to him the Sieurs <hi>Viette, Riffault, Mocquay,</hi> and <hi>Charles de la Coſte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day, about ten in the morning, Sieur <hi>Arnault</hi> preſented himſelf with Paſs-ports for the Deputies, if they would ſend any; and the four a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-named, being choſen, went with him to the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who after hearing them, told them, that he had no Commiſſion from the King to treat with his Subjects of the City of <hi>Rochel,</hi> but only to hear their Propoſitions and Demands: Nevertheleſs, that he would not ceaſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them to his Majeſty, to procure them their Lives, Religion, and Eſtates; but as to their Priviledges, and form of Government, his Majeſty would reſerve that in his own Power: not that he would put Souldiers into the City, nor make a Citadel, but rather demoliſh the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that in a day or two at furtheſt they ſhould return the ſame to him, or other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to accept of; and beſides, that he gave them this Anſwer by word of mouth, he gave it them alſo in writing, in a little Note.</p>
                  <p>Being come back, the Mayor and Council order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Bell of the City-Houſe ſhould be tolled the next day, being <hi>October</hi> 28. at ſeven in the

                  <p>Having compoſed the Articles, and ſhewed them to the Council, the Deputies went from the City betwixt three and four in the Evening, and came to <hi>Sauſay</hi> to wait upon Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> who deferred them till the next morning, but in the interim cauſed them to be well treated, both as to Bed, and Board.</p>
                  <p>The next morning (being the 29th) they were called before him, finding him with my Lords the Keepers of the Seal, Marſhal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords of the Council, and preſented to him their Propoſitions and Demands; upon which he told them, that the King was pleaſed, of pure grace, to grant them their Lives, Eſtates, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience; but as to that Head which imported the treating in general for all thoſe of their Party, that it did not behove them to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing but what concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, according as the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army treated for themſelves apart: and the better to perſwade them to it, he ſhewed them the Deputies from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, but without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to ſpeak together. In the end, after many Conteſts, and above all, about liberty of the exerciſe of their Religion within the City, they agreed upon Articles of Peace, under the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as followeth.</p>

                  <p>The ſeventh of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1628. a Shalloop com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Kings Army, and ſtaying in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the way, called <hi>la Pallice,</hi> with a white Flag, demanded to communicate with the Deputies of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the permiſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General, the Sieur <hi>Forin,</hi> Deputy for the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with ſome others, and Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> (who was ſince made Abbot of <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) went aboard the Shalloop, where they found the Sieur <hi>Treille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi> one of the Kings Captains, and one that made profeſſion of the Reformed Religion, with the Sieur <hi>Liſle,</hi> Adjutant-Major in the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who made Propoſitions to all the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, to retire, and ſeek the Kings Grace and Pardon, aſſuring them, that he would receive them to mercy, and would like it, if they ſhould intercede with him for the City of <hi>Rochel:</hi> upon which they broke, only <hi>Montague</hi> making himſelf known, deſired the above-mentioned <hi>Treillebois</hi> to preſent his ſervice to Cardinal <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thirteenth, there returned four <hi>Engliſh</hi> who had been taken Priſoners by the Kings Ships, and who applauded the good entertainment that had been given them; and ſaid, that they had it in charge from Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> to tell the Sieur <hi>Montague,</hi> that he took his Salutations in good part, and gave him aſſurance of all good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, in caſe he would confer with him; and from thence ſhould hope for good ſucceſs for the two Crowns.</p>
                  <p>The next day, being the 14th <hi>ditto,</hi> the Council
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102984:100"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> was aſſembled, to which was called the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and the Deputies for <hi>Rochel:</hi> The Sieur <hi>Montague</hi> propoſed it as neceſſary, to make a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough diſcovery of the <hi>Digue,</hi> taking occaſion from the invitation that had been made him the day before to go into the Kings Camp, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him an Engineer, he brought back from thence all new aſſurances.</p>
                  <p>The Deputies cryed out againſt that Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhewing, that nothing but miſchief could from thence arrive them, ſince that ſo ſoon as the leaſt noiſe ſhould be ſpread in the Army of a Treaty, they ought not to hope any more that that courage which was already enough damped, would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſolve to fight: And as to the deſign of diſcovering the <hi>Digue,</hi> that thoſe who ſhould do it, were at leaſt as crafty as thoſe who will not ſhew themſelves, except in places moſt perplexed; and that their report about the <hi>Digue</hi> would not ſerve for any thing ſave the breeding of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and diſpondency in the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this oppoſition, <hi>Montague</hi> was reſolved to make the Voyage with a <hi>German</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer; and preſently parting, returned the ſame day, reporting, that Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him well, and made Propoſitions concerning the general good of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> upon which he had charged them to confer with the General.</p>
                  <p>The 15th <hi>ditto, Montague</hi> returned to the Kings Camp, which putting the Deputies into an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, they went aboard the General, repreſenting to him the evil conſequences of ſuch Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to which he anſwered, that there ſhould be nothing done to their prejudice.</p>
                  <p>The 19th, <hi>Montague</hi> returned with his Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102984:100"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> and reported, as was before propheſied, that the <hi>Digue</hi> was altogether inforceable, and that Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had made him Propoſitions, by the means of which <hi>Rochel</hi> might hope for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable treatment, and the two Crowns a good Peace betwixt them; upon which occaſion it was neceſſary for him to go Poſt into <hi>England,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the King what he had in charge.</p>
                  <p>The Deputies hereupon ſaid, that they ſaw now the effects of what they formerly foreſaw, that <hi>Rochel</hi> was not in a condition to expect a Voyage from <hi>England,</hi> ſince they knew her fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neceſſity; and though they had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the <hi>Digue</hi> was inforceable, yet they ought to have eſſayed to force it; and above all, to have made ſhew of imploying one Ship, at leaſt, as a Mine, who having double the powder of thoſe that were imployed at the Palliſades at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> would make a paſſage ſufficient, if the <hi>Digue</hi> were double the ſtrength. In brief, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing of what they judged might be ſaid for breaking this deſign.</p>
                  <p>It was notwithſtanding reſolved, that <hi>Montague</hi> ſhould take Poſt, promiſing to return within fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days at the furtheſt, with promiſes neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs made by the General to the Deputies, that if the Wind did but ſerve, they ſhould ſpare no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>The 21th, the General ſent for Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> and told him, that God ſeemed to fight from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt the paſſionate deſire he had to do ſome generous execution for the relief of <hi>Rochel;</hi> that ſince his arrival, there had ſlipped away 22 days, the Calms, or contrary Winds, having all that time prevented the attempting of the <hi>Digue;</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:102984:101"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> that the Principal of his Army ſeemed to have little affection for the Enterprize, having agreed in opinion, that it was not executable; that from the Head the Malady had infected the Body, in ſuch ſort, that he obſerved throughout in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a great coldneſs; yet notwithſtanding that, he had ſpared nothing, nor would, of that which depended on him, for coming to the end of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; but to provide againſt all Events, and ſuppoſing that the Seaſon might continue unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, he judged it beſt to adviſe the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to commence a Treaty, that they may be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereto againſt the arrival of <hi>Montague,</hi> when all things would be prepared for a good Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, if there be not other means for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it.</p>
                  <p>The Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi> communicated this with the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and the other Deputies, who jointly concluded, that it was abſolutely neceſſary to acquaint thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> herewith, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them of the inſtance that the Sieur <hi>Treille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois</hi> had formerly made them, telling them, that they (their Deputies) were reſolved to intercede with the King for his Grace, and endeavor to bring them (their Fellow-Citizens) to it, that they may owe it to his Bounty, rather than to the Interceſſion of Strangers, and believed that it would be grateful to have Communication thereof with him, and that it behoved them to ſeek the means. This they made known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General, of whom having had the approbation, they diſpatched a Priſoner, called <hi>Farnon,</hi> belonging to the ſaid <hi>Treillebois,</hi> to whom they writ this Letter.</p>

                  <p>The Priſoner was diſpatched the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth with this Letter: Captain <hi>Forant</hi> brought a Ship, about two hundred Tun, well equipped for War, who without reſiſtance was ſuffered to take him aboard, where there commanded one <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi> of the Religion, but long ſuſpected; and where was alſo a Gentleman, called <hi>Beaurepair.</hi> Having preſented theſe to the General, it was found fit to arreſt <hi>Poyane;</hi> and as to the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted, that from the beginning he had things of great conſequence to impart, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſecreſie, they heard him in particular.</p>
                  <p>He declared there, that being come from <hi>Spain,</hi> where he was Priſoner for his Religion, they had
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102984:102"/>
                     <fw>1628. October.</fw> ſtipulated with him to be ſerviceable to the King, upon occaſion, as his Majeſty ſhall find fit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him; that having promiſed any thing to free himſelf from danger, and the miſery he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they had aſſociated him with <hi>Poyane,</hi> to come into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, under pretext of ſerving the Party; and that he had order with the firſt opportune occaſion by night to intangle himſelf with the Generals Ship, or with that of the Duke of <hi>Soubize;</hi> and that ſaving themſelves in a Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loop, ſhould ſet the Powder on fire; and to the end to gain the more credit, his order was to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his ſervice even to carry Letters into <hi>Rochel,</hi> and to bring back Anſwers, in which they would facilitate to him the means of going and coming, without taking notice of him, until he had acted the deſign.</p>
                  <p>Having well deduced the whole by ſteps, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he ſaid, that the other had the intention of thoſe that ſent him, and he his own; and that his chief Obligation being to his Conſcience, and his Religion, he had been willing to declare from the firſt what they had ſtipulated with him, and the deſign of <hi>Poyane,</hi> to the end it might be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And further, that if they judged it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to manage for their advantage what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt them, he was ready (keeping the thing ſecret) to go into the Kings Camp, feigning always to be well intentioned, and to gain belief in what he pretended, he offered to carry their Letters to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and to bring other back, and to execute all faithfully, and acquaint thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> with the truth, and what they ſhould deſire him to impart to them, and bring them back again the eſtate and condition of the City.</p>

                        <p>BEſides the general Letter, I write this to you in particular, to which, though it is not ſigned by any but my ſelf, you may pleaſe, nevertheleſs, to give an entire belief to it; becauſe that what the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> writeth to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will confirm to you the Contents: The one, and the other, is to teſtifie to you our extreme fears from the Voyage of Sieur <hi>Montague</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great appearance, that he hath agreed upon ſome things with the Cardinal to our prejudice, and that he is

Beſides this, we find our ſelves under another trouble which is greater, to wit, that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve too viſibly a great coldneſs in many, from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which they would impreſs upon themſelves, that it is impoſſible to force the <hi>Digue.</hi> Againſt theſe two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which are extreme, we would with all our might provide ſome Remedies: And as to the firſt, the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> hath writ effectually to the ſaid King, and I moſt particularly to Monſieur <hi>David;</hi> and that which gives us hope that they will not advance any thing againſt us on that ſide, is, that knowing the true generous Inclinations of that Prince, we cannot think that any thing is capable to turn him from that which he hath ſo often promiſed us, except that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> officiouſly foretelling, that if we do not relieve you before his return, your extremities cannot wait for him; ſo that we muſt either ſave you ſpeedily, or you will be for ever loſt. Our greateſt labour is to keep up the ſpirits of the people from fainting, among whom there are many, who for to palliate their Cowardice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the fear of want of Victuals, as alſo the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is begun in ſeveral Ships. Contrary to this, we endeavour all we can to fortifie the General, who as to himſelf is moſt well diſpoſed, and promiſeth us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that with the firſt favourable Wind he will do what is poſſible to finiſh the Enterpriſe. In like manner the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who is Vice-Admiral, and the Principal Captains, promiſe us marvels, and there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not an hour that we do not ſollicit them, eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> applies himſelf therein with an extraordinary affection and aſſiduity; nevertheleſs, he and we fear, that thoſe upon whom depends the next execution, will not ſecond the good intentions of their Captains, but do as ill as they did in the ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque;

                           <fw>1628. October.</fw> and that whilſt time ſlips away, it will coſt us our ruine. And thus thinking it entirely neceſſary to have two Cords to our Ark, and ſeeing that <hi>Montague</hi> hath opened the way to a Treaty, it is adviſeable to try what is to be done on that ſide; and therefore after having ingaged the General by a moſt ſolemn promiſe, that he will keep his word, for giving way to it, when God ſhall preſent the occaſion, we diſpatched yeſterday a Priſoner to Monſieur <hi>Treillebois,</hi> (who had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore invited us to ſeek the King, aſſuring us, that he would receive you into favour) to whom we have writ, that if he will procure for us a Paſs port, two of us will go to the Camp to confer with ſuch as his Majeſty ſhall appoint, and contribute what in us lies for the gaining a good Accommodation. We expect an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to our Letter; and if this Paſs-port be granted us, our deſign is to hear what will be propoſed to us, and without rejecting or approving any thing, carry our ſelves ſo, that they may give us Paſs-ports for to go and confer with you. This is the true condition of our Affairs, which I aſſure my ſelf will cauſe great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity in you; but in my Opinion, all that you can do at preſent is, to write preſſingly to the General, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the indignity it will be to him, if after you have ſo long languiſhed, and ſeen the greateſt part of your Fellow-Citizens die of famine, in the expectation of ſo often reiterated promiſes from his Majeſty, which he was come to execute, he ſhould either return without having imployed the Power that he was furniſhed with, for relieving you, or be a means of an Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they have put the Knife to your Throats. When you ſhall pleaſe to write us, I beſeech you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs very particularly your ſtate and condition, and above all, how long you can yet hold out, we aſſuring you, that we will manage it with all imaginable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,

                  <p>The 24th <hi>ditto</hi> they received Paſs-ports, under the Faith of which Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi> and <hi>Bragneau</hi> went the next morning in a Shalloop to the half way, to <hi>de la Palice,</hi> to confer with the Sieurs <hi>Treillebois</hi> and <hi>Liſle,</hi> with whom they ſpoke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Letter written at firſt, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if it pleaſed his Majeſty to give them Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for <hi>Rochel,</hi> they would do what was poſſible for them to diſpoſe their Fellow-Citizens to ſeek his Grace, rather than to come to extremity; and told them in their ear, that though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not conſent unto a Treaty except by their Interceſſion, they ſhould not be wanting by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to perſwade their Fellow-Citizens to have recourſe rather to his Majeſty directly, as judging it would be more agreeable to him, than by ingaging Strangers in it.</p>

                  <p>He anſwered, that what they ſaid for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did not ſurmount theirs or their Fellow-Citizens faults, which they confeſſed to be great; but the bounty of the King was yet greater for pardoning of them, to whom he would freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Interceſſion, if on their part they would return to their duty; and thereupon he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, what aſſurance they had of thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which gave them hopes of being able to bring them to a ſubmiſſion.</p>

                  <p>The Cardinal being profoundly attentive to all this diſcourſe, commended the good intentions which they gave teſtimony of, and ſaid, that they took the right way, in having recourſe directly to the grace of his Majeſty, which will be better and more ſurely granted them, than if a Forreign

                  <p>They anſwered, that they would give two good Aſſurances; one, that the Intereſt of thoſe for whom they acted required it; the other, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Deputies, one ſhould remain (if it pleaſed the King) as caution with his Head, for the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Companion, excepting only the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal ſaid, that he hoped that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would truſt them, and approve of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject deſigned by them to this end; and to give them light in what they were to treat of, he told them his intentions touching them, that he would not conceal from them, that the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> preſſed his Majeſty, and to ſuch a point, that days to him were years; and that he would buy them at a dear rate; that thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> had given him to underſtand, that they had yet enough for three full Months: If ſo, he would give them a blank Paper to write their own Conditions; but if they were not able to hold out longer, it was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that obdurate obſtinacy ſhould have ſuch Conditions as a free and voluntary ſubmiſſion; and propounded in the firſt place, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhould ſend Commiſſioners into the City, with whom their Deputies ſhould be joyned, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Proviſions, and to make a faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof, reiterating, that if they had to hold out three Months, they ſhould grant them ſuch Capitulations as themſelves ſhould deſire; but if extreme neceſſity forced them to render, it was but juſt to do it upon diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>In reply to this, they ſupplicated him not to

                     <fw>1628.

                  <p>The Cardinal made hereunto anſwer, that the repreſentation merited conſideration, and that he would the ſame day go to his Majeſty, and hoped to procure his approbation for their going to their Fellow-Citizens, according as they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>The Deputies returning him thanks, added, that they hoped that his Majeſty would conſider, that though the Crimes of their Fellow-Citizens were moſt great, and that they would not pretend to excuſe them no more than themſelves; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the <hi>Flower de Luces,</hi> which have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained entire upon their Gates and Walls, were yet more in their hearts, and that they had always conſerved them there; and that becauſe they ſhewed themſelves deaf to divers Propoſitions, by which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would have detached their Fidelity from this Crown, they had ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded their ſuccours, and ſuffered them to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. He anſwered with a benign Countenance, and that which evidenced his Approbation of what they ſaid: We know, ſaid the Cardinal, that what you ſay is true, and it is the only door left you to enter by into the favour of the King your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
                  <p>Parting thus from him, they hoped that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

                  <p>This made them, the Deputies from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army preſume, that the City having received their Letters of the twenty third, they agreed with them, that it was to no purpoſe to expect any thing from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by force of Arms, and for what was of Treaty, that they had the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as they had had; that it would be of more advantage and ſecurity to them, to ſeek by themſelves the favour of his Majeſty, than by the Interceſſion of any ſo little agreeable, as one might judge that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be; and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving altogether their Counſels, they regretted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that having writ them, that they would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Paſs-port for going to them, they had not expected the effect, for that it had been better that they ſhould have ſought it for them, rather than themſelves, which adminiſtred jealouſie of a great extremity.</p>
                  <p>As theſe Deputies reaſoned thus one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other Deputies from the City were with the Cardinal, and other Miniſters of State, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Conditions; who to obtain the better, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give jealouſie of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours; upon which it was told them, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed themſelves in relying upon them, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having loſt all hopes of doing any thing for their relief, had ſent their own Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to manage a particular Treaty for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking of <hi>Rochel:</hi> And when they made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty

                  <p>When they were a-part they all agreed that the Cardinal had dealt with them with more Art than was common, in making them, the ſeveral Deputies from the City and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, to ſee one another without ſuffering them to ſpeak toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſo he might make uſe of their ſeveral Diſcourſes to each Party, as might beſt ſerve his turn. But however, finding that their laſt Letters to the City had been delivered, by which they had acquainted them how they had managed a Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for going to them, they concluded that the Council of the City could not be wanting in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing their Deputies ſent to Court with the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their Letters, that they might thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the cauſe of their coming thither: Beſides, there were ſome of their Company, who, upon all occaſions, came to ſee them, and particularly they found means to ſpeak with Sieur <hi>de Liſle,</hi> who without making ſhew of it, had always had his Eye upon them, and coming to them, told them, That the City-Deputies were adviſed that they were there upon their Accounts, to endeavour

                     <fw>1628.

                  <p>Theſe Deputies from the City, being returned thither the ſame day, went again the next day and concluded the Rendition under the Articles which they eſteemed good, or to expreſs it better, ſuch as they could obtain without, that the other come from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army having any part in them, or that it was then poſſible for them to know the truth of what they were agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>The Deputies from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army knowing in general that the Treaty was concluded without making any mention of them, becauſe the King would not ſuffer it, they ſupplicated the Cardinal to procure them alſo the Grace of his Majeſty; and to the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to all thoſe which the Commotions had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced either into <hi>England,</hi> or other Countries, which he promiſed them; and having ordered them to treat thereof with Monſieur <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> in the end they obtained the Declaration of 29. <hi>Octob.</hi> importing, That the King pardoned them for all things paſſed, permitting them to come again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Havens, even with the Prizes that they had taken; for that they ſhould enjoy the ſame Grace as his other Subjects, with free exerciſe of their Religion, giving them all their Goods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Fruits received, and Debts confiſcated

                  <p>The Keys of the City being brought to the King the 29. and his Troops entering the 30. it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed among the ſaid Deputies, That the Sieur <hi>Gobert</hi> ſhould go to the City, and Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to whom having carried this ill news, the General expreſſed his great diſlike of it, and the more becauſe <hi>Montague,</hi> having uſed the diligence he promiſed, was returned, and had brought all neceſſary Orders for the Treaty, to which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had very willingly conſented, but were deſirous to have had all to paſs thorough their hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Montague</hi> upon the whole was very angry that his runnings had been unprofitable, and fell upon Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi> in full Council for rendering of the City, blaming their impatience, and accuſing them of having ill requited the King of <hi>England</hi>'s good will towards them.</p>
                  <p>The Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi> anſwered him, That he would force a man wounded with grief to tear it from his Boſom; and told him, That as to his poor Country, in behalf of which he durſt ſo unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe him, it was he, and ſuch as he, that by their ſecret Conſpiracies had reduced it to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition wherein it now was: That he did not ſpeak of his ſerene Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Intentions he knew had always been for ſaving of this poor City; nor did he intend the preſent General, of whoſe ſincerity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will he deſired to be very cautious; but as to <hi>Montague,</hi> and others of his Faction, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand had been nouriſhed by him, they had always

That having then theſe juſt reproaches againſt him, it ill became him to complain of thoſe that he had ruined, and was the cauſe of all whereof he accuſeth them. It was notorious to all that the City had given proof of a miraculous and not to be parallel'd Conſtancy, and were left by them to dye by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; for expecting the performance of the word of their King, their Maſter, and the relief that he had promiſed them; that the Succours arriving after ſo long expectation they ſaw them remain a whole Month making ſuch feeble Attaques as ſeemed to be in jeſt, leaving Famine to finiſh her laſt ſpoiles, adventuring the City to be taken away by their firſt Attaque, as conſidering their feebleneſs and ſmall number it had indubitable been, had the Enemy made the leaſt Attempt; That if in the end they did capitulate they knew

Hereupon they reſolved (ſince it behoved them to render, and not to act any longer as they had done) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Capitulation, which at leaſt would conſerve their lives. Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi> called Heaven and Earth, and all honeſt men that were preſent, to witneſs if it were not unjuſt and inhumane to lay the blame of this occaſion upon them, thereby to raviſh them of the ſole Conſolation left them in their miſery, and ſo to leave nothing und one that might aggravate their ſufferings, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to defend them who have witneſſed a Conſtancy, which Poſterity will think a Prodigy, or hardly believe it.</p>
                  <p>The General, who carried fair to Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> acknowledged the truth of that which he ſaid; and, ſeeing him tranſported with grief, ſtayed the Diſcourſe, and reſtrained <hi>Montague,</hi> who, in great paſſion, demanded reparation for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſo left the Company.</p>

                  <p>This was the cauſe of a long Conteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſome inclining to return, and others ſaid, they could not truſt to the promiſes that had been made.</p>
                  <p>Sieur <hi>Vincent</hi>'s advice being thereupon deſired, he repreſented to them, that conſidering the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sentiments which he found them in, he could not judge it in his power to ſatisfie all: That it was true, that thoſe who ſhewed diffidence, wanted not apparent reaſon for it; but in his opinion there was more than enough to aſſure him, that the Treaty had been made by the Interceſſion of the Cardinal, who was very jealous of his word, that fear of it ought to proceed from ſome great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which would redound from the breach of it, as there can be none at all for <hi>Rochel,</hi> with its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, being now given up as the price of our Lives, Eſtates, and Liberty; thoſe remaining in the Ruines are not other ways conſidered, than as other private perſons of the Religion in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of <hi>Bries;</hi> that an evil Treatment is not to be feared, but with reaſon to expect favour, ſeeing <hi>Montauban</hi> and the other Cities hold out; yet ſo, that the uſage of <hi>Rochel</hi> will be a Preſident of hope or fear to them. As to himſelf, they knew that he would be well received if he returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

                  <p>The greateſt part yielding to theſe Reaſons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take the benefit of the Declaration; but the next morning, the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> there were ſome that changed their minds: That which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed aboard Captain <hi>Bragneau,</hi> being come to the knowledge of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome repreſented to the General, that if they parted with the <hi>French,</hi> they ſhould be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo weakned, as not to be able to execute the Enterpriſes they deſigned, amongſt which there was one upon <hi>Brouage</hi> not to be acted until their return, when they ſhall have need of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all along the Coaſt, even unto the Channel, or Narrow Seas, becauſe they had more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein than they had: Above all, that it would concern the Honour of their King, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his Banner, they ſhould make a Treaty without him, nor ought they to ratifie it, but leave the thing entire to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The Council being aſſembled, it was hereupon reſolved to carry all the <hi>French,</hi> and even the Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> to give an account to the King of what he had done in the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The General having ſent for him aboard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with it; to which he anſwered, that

As to him in particular, if he had no regard but to himſelf, he knew he ſhould have the Kings ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and that which would be much better for him, than what he could hope for from a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late City, where he foreſaw he ſhould ſuffer great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſee Spies upon him in his future imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and upon the leaſt ſuſpition, in danger of his life; but he prayed him to conſider the Cords that obliged him to his Fellow-Citizens, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cheriſhed him in their proſperity, he ſhould be unworthy and treacherous if he forſook them in their adverſity: Above all, that being one of their Paſtors, he ſhould never forget, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not in this great Shock, to do all that he could (according to the ability God had given him) for to help to ſuſtain and comfort them under their misfortunes. In the end, thoſe that had given the advice to carry him back, found it not (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) for their Intereſt to do it, becauſe if once he ſhould have had the Honour to ſpeak to the

                  <p>The General heard this diſcourſe with attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having communicated it with the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Laval,</hi> retracted the firſt advice of carrying back all the Veſſels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained it to ſome particulars, and among others, to that of Captain <hi>Bragneau;</hi> and then gave a Shalloop to Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> of whom the General and Chief Officers took an amicable leave; and ſo he was brought the ſecond of <hi>November</hi> to the Chain croſs the <hi>Digue:</hi> ſome alſo of the <hi>French</hi> Veſſels put here and there into Havens, whilſt the reſt were obliged to follow the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſet ſail on <hi>Saturday</hi> the fourth in the Evening.

                  <p>Having tranſcribed this, as aforeſaid, out of the Journal of Sieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> I thought it my duty to inſert it here.</p>

                  <p>After this, they approved with one Voice all their Negotiation, only ſome objected, that the Preamble to the Articles ſeemed rude; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, in the word <hi>Crime,</hi> which was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted;

               <p>Among the infinite mercies that God hath pleaſed to beſtow upon us, that moſt ſignal and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, his having given us power and ſtrength
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102984:122"/>not to yield to the dreadful Troubles, Confuſions, and Diſorders, which were found at our coming to this Kingdom, divided into ſo many Parties and Factions, that the moſt legitimate was almoſt the leaſt, enabling us with conſtancy, in ſuch manner to oppoſe the ſtorm, as in the end to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount it, reducing this Eſtate to peace and reſt; for which to him alone be given the honour and glory, and us the grace to acknowledge our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in having our labours made uſe of for the accompliſhing ſo good a work, in which it hath been viſible to all, that we have not only done what was our duty, and in our power, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than at another time, would (peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) have been agreeable to the Dignity we now hold; as in not having had more care, than to have many times ſo freely expoſed our own life. And in this great concurrence of weighty and perillous Affairs, not being able to compoſe all at one and the ſame time, we have choſen this Order. Firſt to undertake thoſe who were not to be ſuppreſſed but by force, and rather to remit and ſuſpend others for ſome time, who might be dealt with by reaſon and juſtice: for for the general differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among our good Subjects, and the particular evils of the ſoundeſt parts of the State, we judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be eaſily cured, after the principal cauſe (the continuation of the Civil Wars) was taken away, in which we have, by the bleſſing of God, well and happily ſucceeded, all Hoſtility and Wars thorough the Kingdom being now ceaſed, and we hope he will alſo proſper us in our other affairs, which remain to be compoſed, and that by this means we ſhall arrive at the Eſtabliſhment of a good Peace, with tranquillity and reſt, (which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102984:122"/>hath ever been the end of all our vows and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) as all the reward we deſire or expect for ſo much pain and trouble, as we have taken in the whole courſe of our life. Amongſt our ſaid affairs (towards which it behoves us to have patience) one of the principal hath been, the many complaints we have received from divers of our Provinces and Catholick Cities, for that the exerciſe of the Catholick Religion was not univerſally re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as is provided by Edicts or Statutes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore made for the Pacification of the troubles ariſing from Religion; as alſo the Supplications and Remonſtrances which have been made to us by our Subjects of the Reformed Religion, as well upon the execution of what hath been granted them by the ſaid former Laws, as that they deſire to have ſome addition for the exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the liberty of their Conſciences, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Perſons and Fortunes: preſuming to have juſt reaſons for deſiring ſome inlargement of Articles, as not being without great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, becauſe their ruine hath been the principal pretext and original foundation of the late Wars, Troubles, and Commotions. Now not to burden us with too much buſineſs at once, as alſo that the fury of War was not compatible with the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Laws, how good ſoever they might be, we have hitherto deferred from time to time giving remedy herein. But now that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to give us a beginning of injoying ſome reſt, we think we cannot imploy our ſelf better, than to apply to that which may tend to the glory and ſervice of his holy Name, and to provide that he may be adored and prayed unto by all our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and if it hath not yet pleaſed him to permit
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102984:123"/>it to be in one and the ſame Form of Religion, that it may at the leaſt be with one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and with ſuch Rules as may prevent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all trouble or tumults: and that we and this Kingdom may always conſerve the glorious Title of moſt Chriſtian, which hath been by ſo much merit ſo long ſince acquired: and by the ſame means take away the cauſe of miſchief and trouble, which may happen from the actions of Religion, which of all others are moſt prevalent and penetrating. For this cauſe, acknowledging this affair to be of the greateſt importance, and worthy of the beſt conſideration, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Papers of Complaints of our Catholick Subjects, and having alſo permitted to our Subjects of the Reformed Religion to aſſemble themſelves by Deputies, for framing their complaints, and making a Collection of all their Remonſtrances; and having thereupon conferred divers times with them, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the precedent Laws, we have upon the whole judged it neceſſary to give to all our ſaid Subjects one general Law, clear, pure, and abſolute, by which they ſhall be regulated in all differences which have heretofore riſen among them, or may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after riſe, wherewith the one and other may be contented, being framed according as the time requires: and having had no other regard in this deliberation, than ſolely the zeal we have to the ſervice of God, praying that he would hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward render to all our ſaid Subjects a durable and eſtabliſhed Peace. Upon which we implore and expect from his Divine bounty the ſame protection and favour, as he hath always viſibly beſtowed upon this Kingdom from our Birth, during the many years we have attained unto, and give our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102984:123"/>ſaid Subjects the grace to underſtand, that in the obſervation of this our Ordinance conſiſteth (after that which is their duty towards God and us) the principal foundation of their union, concord, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, reſt, and the re-eſtabliſhment of all this Eſtate in its firſt ſplendour, opulency, and ſtrength. As on our part we promiſe to cauſe all to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved, without ſuffering any contradiction. And for theſe cauſes, having with the advice of the Princes of our Blood, other Princes and Officers of our Crown, and other great and eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our Council of State, being near us, well and diligently weighed and conſidered all this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair: WE HAVE by this Edict or Statute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and irrevocable ſaid, declared, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, declaring, and ordaining;</p>

Having to that effect, immediately after his coming to the Crown, confirmed the ſaid Edicts, by his Letters Patents in form of a Declaration, dated the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

This makes us to hope that comporting as good and Loyal Subjects, and living in that Union and Concord, which is requiſite for the good of our Service, we may as it is our greateſt deſire, with Divine aſſiſtance, and under the prudent and wiſe adminiſtration of the Queen Regent our moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Dame and Mother, whoſe good and ſincere intentions are known to every one, make all our Subjects, as well Catholicks as of the ſaid Reformed Religion, to be ſenſible of our affection towards them, and of our deſire of maintaining them in a firm and aſſured peace.
